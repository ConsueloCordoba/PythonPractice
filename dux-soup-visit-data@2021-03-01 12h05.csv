And it isn‚Äôt like football, or rocket science, or pop stardom ‚Äì which you dream about as a child. Architectural lighting design is the passion I discovered at university, while training as a set designer. I loved being able to create atmospheric spaces using nothing but light, and I soon realised that I could achieve the same effect in the real world rather than a stage set: I could light up spaces and affect the emotions of all who entered it.  I‚Äôve worked in this industry for 20 years now, and in 2011 I set up Nulty Lighting. We‚Äôre an award-winning practice with one simple mission: to delight, excite and inspire people with our creations. Whether we‚Äôre working on a restaurant, a luxury home, a hotel or a public square, we believe that how a place feels is just as important as how it looks.

This interesting, exciting sector is growing daily & helping people embrace the Internet of Things (IoT) is just a small part of how I can help your town or city achieve a fully integrated infrastructure which is truly SMART.   A key part of my work involves lighting for Section 278 & 38 approvals.  Lighting for ecology features heavily so it‚Äôs my job to ensure we satisfy ecologists & keep our natural world safe during the design process.  We have had 100% success in achieving approvals for SSSi‚Äôs, SCNI‚Äôs & ANOB‚Äôs because I truly care about the outcome and its impact.  My background in lighting spans many years & as my experience has grown so has my love of this industry & the work I do.

I started designing and making bespoke lampshades after failing to find an off-the-shelf shade that really inspired me. Whilst my lampshades are beautiful objects during the day, they take on another meaning at night and will totally transform to reveal their hidden secret once lit.

In the 2003 I knew thanks to Targetti Sankey SPA and his project of Lighting Advisor the World of the Lighting and then I was intrigued by the potentialities and variety of the sector. After Targetti and NERI SPA, I'm joined, in the Roman branch, the iGuzzini Lighting SPA: with them, in the 8 years of the Italian experience, I contributed to the realisation of hundreds of projects in all the sectors of Architecture. In 2014 I decided with the Company to join the UK Branch, one of the most important in the world for the turnover and the market itself. I worked in particular in the Retail sector, very important for iGuzzini and not just for them, but I followed also other kinds of projects. Then, after over 10 years in the same Company, I decided to leave it and joined INTO Lighting Ltd, a Lighting Design practice very well based and known in LONDON. Here I deal and will deal mostly to develop the contacts and clients network, and, as Project Manager, to manage existing clients offering all he services that this Company can offer.  After this experience I decided to join my 'first love' in the lighting sector, so I chose Targetti Sankey the historical brand based in Flroence.  Actually I'm based in the London office in Bishopgate and with the other guys, we are trying to grow the turnover of this iconic Brand. After more than three years in Targetti I've been appointed as UK & Ireland Sales Director for the PENTA GROUP LIGHTING.

My early career was as an engineer for companies such as Brown Boveri, Chubb, Sinclair and Cescom. This solid engineering base assisted in my 1st venture being the development of micro-controller based laser projection systems. These systems were sold throughout the 80‚Äôs/90‚Äôs and were exported to 47 countries.  This evolutionary process meant that I gained an early experience in Export Sales to such countries as China, Thailand, Indonesia and indeed many of the emerging nations. My job function then changed from engineering to sales and in particular the export market. This market place also allowed the company to develop product for the event and corporate markets. The company established a brand and reputation for this market and went on to carry out events such as the Sarajevo Olympics, Indonesia national Day, Pon as well as corporate events for such companies as Panasonic, Sony. Rover and many other blue chip brands The year 2000 celebrations were also seen as an opportunity for my experience and to this end I, together with Darren Wring started a company known as illuminatum to cater for this event. The company carried out celebrations for 5 Cities, being Liverpool, Belfast, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Leeds and Southampton. The early part of this millennium saw a change in the market place away from existing lighting technology and on to energy efficient light sources.

The company principally carries out lighting design work, within the UK and Ireland, for a wide variety of clients who require a lighting designer / consultant to deal with specific lighting requirements associated with their project. The company has the experience and knowledge to be able to produce lighting designs solutions that meet the appropriate relevant adoptable lighting standards. Alternatively specific lighting design solutions can be produced for private areas that are not going to be adopted by the local council (Private Cable networks are normally designed for this type of work too). MMA Lighting Consultancy is an established company who has formed excellent working relationships with many Local Authorities around the UK. Many of these relationships have been formed by making contact with the local councils prior to commencing lighting design work on proposed development schemes in their areas. This gives the councils the confidence that the specific lighting scheme will be delivered to their specification and also gives the councils a single point of contact should the specification need to be amended at any point. We have carried out work for many different Local Authorities, Land Developers, Property Developers, Engineering Consultants and Architectural Practices who require the expertise offered by a Lighting Design Consultant. We use the latest computer design techniques available, which include the latest versions of AutoCAD, Lighting Reality and Philips Calculux where required. All our street lighting designs are prepared on ‚Äò*DWG‚Äô AutoCAD plans on our own drawing frames or a border of the client‚Äôs choice.  If you would like to discuss a street lighting design project or development site with us, then please feel free to give us a call on 0118 321 5636.

However, they often dread the thought of cabling it themselves and missing something or choosing something that's messy and unreliable. Typically they've tried gathering three competitve quotes, but quickly get frustrated when the quotes are confusing, don't compare, don't match requirements and are often over budget. They frequently feel pressured into committing to one wrong quote or another, or giving up more time to get the quotes right. All to receive the information needed to wire a property. We also work with clients who already have smart technology, but are frustrated that they don't perform as expected, they aren't getting the attention they need and never get the most from their investment. We advise on designing, budgeting, wiring, installing and maintaining smart technology without the need to commit to hardware. That can be for a home, office, hotel or restaurant. We provide all of the information you need. So you can go out to competitive tender, should you chose, and be confident in gathering like for like quotations. Or you can leave in our hands to design, supply, install and ook after everything on an ongoing basis. There is no pressure or obligation from our side and simply an initial conversation to see if we can help move your project forwards. Feel free to contact me directly to discuss.

From there Simon started his own Production Lighting Services Company and over the next twenty years, worked on numerous large scale Corporate, West End and Touring Productions (many of the Theatre shows supplied by White Light) including some well known classics such as Miss Saigon, Les Miserables, Oliver, Mutiny, Metropolis, Tommy, Carousel, Oklahoma, Grease, We Will Rock You, Blue Man Group, Mamma Mia, Spamalot, Sunset Boulevard and countless others. Although Simon has managed many Specialist Installation Projects for White Light over the years, he didn't join the Company full-time until 2008. He took responsibility for the City of Dreams Project in Macau and the Visitor's Centre in N√ºrburgring, Germany before accepting a seat on the board as Special Projects Director. White Light Major Projects continues to provide Consultancy, Project Management, System Design & Integration with Specialist Installation Services across the UK and Internationally.  The White Light Major Projects division grew out of a demand from the permanent installation market requiring a specialist that could combine an awareness of building construction skills, with the understanding of technical standards required to create a usable performance space and the solutions needed.

But one event took place in 2018 which dwarves the rest and it‚Äôs one that I certainly wasn‚Äôt prepared for. My trip to the Arctic was a memorable experience but nothing had prepared me for what was to come and how this event really did change my life. During the expedition I came face to face with the downstream effects of plastic pollution and global warming. I saw life in its harshest form and learnt from the many scientists and experts through a series of lectures which would take place each evening following the day‚Äôs activity.  As a result of this experience I have found it difficult to adapt to ‚Äònormal life‚Äô. People say I‚Äôve had an epiphany and that may well be true but one thing is for sure, my life will never be the same again My focus is now well and truly directed on the environment and ways in which I can make a difference in the industry where I‚Äôve spent most of my working life. I am doing this in two parts. Firstly, I have redoubled our efforts at Aztec to ensure we are doing as much as possible to reduce our environmental impact, minimise waste and recycle - across all aspects of the business.   This work will continue as we educate our staff and clients in the crucial role we all have to play if we‚Äôre not going to destroy this amazing planet and the creatures we share it with. The second part is through a new organisation I have established with support from the University of Liverpool called `Changing Streams CIC`. We are a 'not for profit' organisation focused on eradicating plastics at source, in the first instance within the construction sector. Our aims and objectives can be seen on our new website. By reducing the amount of plastic being used we can, and will make a positive impact in reducing waste going to landfill or worse still, into the ocean.  Please join us in whichever way you feel able.","2020","Chairman Of The Board","AZTEC INTERIORS (NORTHERN) LIMITED","https://www.linkedin.com/company/19366862"," "," "," "," ","NealAztec","Greater Liverpool Area","Construction","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

Ever since I can remember I've always been intrigued with how things work & how they're made. I've aligned this core interest with a passion for large scale and high impact events which I've been fortunate to deliver internationally for some of the worlds largest technology brands.  The highest standard of delivery is the only work method I know which I achieve with a diverse skillset and a large network of trusted suppliers internationally. We often say there is no 'I' in team and there is never a truer statement for the event industry. As a core team player I excel at my role whilst leading that team or being a part of it to ensure a successful end result.  I have diverse industry experience inclusive of ceremonies, music events, sporting events, conferences, exhibitions and special events. More recently my work has centred around large scale projects for technology clients which has fed my interest and career development. I have experience working with budgets of ¬£5m+ and thrive in the usual high pressure environments of the industry.  Outside the office, my thirst for technology knowledge continues and you'll find me researching the latest technology developments and how they're affecting the world as know it today. The remaining free time is often spent with friends and family or putting some time into my own self starter project (currently WeWait) that offers technology based solutions to current problems in society.  Key Competencies: Extensive event industry experience | Managing large teams | Budget management | Supplier management | Extraordinary attention to detail | Thrives in high pressure environment | Adobe Creative Suite knowledge | Office, GSuite, Keynote knowledge | Vectorworks & AutoCAD knowledge |","2017","Senior Production Manager","BrandFuel Ltd","https://www.linkedin.com/company/963669","http://www.brandfuel.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Events Services","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

His first encounter with the property sector was when he was asked if he could help a large global property agency harness new visualisation technologies and processes to better communicate and market their own brand and more specifically how they can better visualise their client‚Äôs trophy assets to increase sales values through visual impact and shorten sales cycles through clearer understanding.  As a result of this encounter it was clear that there was a gap within the market that he knew how to fill. So he launched 42iQ.com in 2013 as a dedicated all-in-one PropTech production agency to disrupt the industry with many proprietary solutions including Virtual Reality, Hyper Realistic Real-time Applications, High Quality Film and Computer Generated Content.

Operated 3 mobile nightclubs under 'The 2001 Space Odyssey' brand at the age of 17 before leaving for the continent.  After 2 years working in Denmark I accepted the position as House DJ for German club Guru, Peter Cook of 'MicMac Hamburg,' where I entertained for 3 years.  I followed my passion for lighting design at Satel off-shoot company 'Coperluf' Spain where I designed and developed entertainment lighting.  'Abstract' was founded in 1990 and I've followed my passion ever since designing famous products such as the Twister- Probably the most reproduced disco light in the world.  1998 was the year I became a Captain PPLH, owning and flying a Robinson R44 Helicoptor that I have flown ever since.  Personal bests include the AVR cm50 the worlds first MR16 colour changing downlighter, selling over 100,000 pieces and the ground breaking VR8 intelligent scanner becoming the most admired light of its time- breaking the mould of composite lighting forever In January 2010 On the high street I delivered cutting edge world first pure white LED track lighting for such as Topshop, Debenhams, Gap, Mulberry,HOF and Asda our true early adopters of LED. Now we have excelled with beautiful lighting facades such as M&M world Leicester Square, London, Commercial bank Doha and the Architectual masterpiece award winning Twin Sails Bridge sequential handrail LED.  Next my intention is to innovate LED to the next level. Innovation is my true passion, the air that I breathe. And with every breath I take I intend to expel true innovation that will take Abstract AVR to the next level.  'Abstract is an amazing mothership and she has served us well for decades. We can do no other than to do our upmost best to feed her. Abstract is like no other! Our competitors Zig while some Zag, yet they will never understand our ability to Zog!'

Having now completed 36 years as my own boss I would consider myself to be competent in most business disciplines. I am good at delegation and have built a strong management team from other cabinetmakers who have followed me from the shopfloor. I now concentrate on sales and marketing but continue to design when I can. The success of the company has allowed me to devote time to wider industry roles with the aim of increasing awareness of our sector within government and encouraging young people to enter the  skilled trades.

His research interests and expertise are at the intersection of parametric design, the representation of space, building performance simulation, and robotic fabrication in architecture. During the period 1996 to 2008, Dr. Jabi led the Association for Computer-Aided Design in Architecture (ACADIA), secured a $250,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to study design creativity, and taught at various universities before moving to the UK in 2008. He is currently a Reader (tenured Associate Professor) at the Welsh School of Architecture, Cardiff University where he leads the digital design area. Dr. Jabi has published widely on topics ranging from parametric and generative design to the role of light in architecture and building performance simulation. He is a member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Architectural Computing (IJAC). In 2013, Dr. Jabi authored the book ‚ÄúParametric Design for Architecture‚Äù (Laurence King Publishing, London). Dr. Jabi secured a ¬£70,000 ($100,000 USD) grant to purchase a large 6-axis high accuracy industrial robot to investigate innovative digital fabrication processes of architectural components and structures and has since published several papers on his research. In 2016, Dr. Jabi secured a ¬£300,000 ($420,000 USD) grant from the Leverhulme Trust for a Research Project Grant titled ‚ÄúEnhancing the representation of architectural space in 3D modelling environments‚Äù. In this project, the team will develop a conceptual framework and schema for the hierarchical and cellular spatial representation of buildings through a concept called non-manifold topology and a set of algorithms and tools that test the potential of this approach. They will conduct four use case scenarios in the areas of: Energy Analysis, Structural Analysis, Spatial Reasoning, and Fabrication Planning.","2017","Course Director, MSc Computational Methods in Architecture","Cardiff University / Prifysgol Caerdydd","https://www.linkedin.com/company/9126","http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/"," "," "," ","wassimj","Greater Cardiff Area","Higher Education","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

As time passed I wanted to develop new skills and grow Genco Build. Demand for my services grew and soon I also started to offer bathroom and kitchen re-fits with the help of my ever-growing team. Genco Build has flourished by reputation and recommendation and it has grown to become a successful business offering commercial and residential development to Surrey, Kent and London. Working closely with our customers I decided to turn my attention to design and manufacturing.

Over the years, I built up a home studio and produced various work for commercial release as well as freelance corporate music production.  I ended up as the house sound engineer in a live music venue and then associate lecturer in Music Technology and Studio Recording. But during the 90s rave years, my tastes and creativity had shifted and I became increasingly more involved in stage lighting. This resulted in running laser shows at raves on the London underground party scene and meeting and working with some truly wonderful creative people. Eventually this become a full time job and business. I have also re-discovered my love and passion for playing the piano and have a new (smaller) home studio, that now includes a Moog Etherwave Theremin. Which I play ..badly!

In 2012 I programmed the underlying KNX and DALI building automation systems that run The Crystal, one of the greenest buildings in the world, a year after graduating with a degree in Computer Science from Loughborough University. The Crystal since went on to be a finalist for the Best International KNX Project in the category Europe at the KNX Awards 2014, and won KNX Installation of the Year at the KNX UK Annual Awards 2014. Since then amongst other wide ranging projects, I have led the engineering of 3,500 KNX devices and 6,000 DALI light fittings at the Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, and implemented HTML-based web apps to allow dynamic control of lighting and blinds from mobiles and tablets at the RIBA Stirling Prize winning Newport Street Gallery, and at the headquarters of the Red Bull Racing F1 team in Milton Keynes. In recent years I have worked very closely with the developers at Tridium, offering advice and recommendations on the new KNX driver for the Niagara Framework, along with pioneering in house web-based validation tools that validate KNX, DALI and Niagara programming against a set of defined naming convention rules and CAD drawings, to wipe out human error. In addition to this, I've architected from scratch a set of head end graphic generation tools that are used to automate the production of lighting graphics; reducing weeks of work into hours, and at the same time removing all scope for human error.

It also includes developing technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the flue gases of power plants and chimneys, as well as burn the fuels in pure oxygen (Oxy-fuel), which results in a flue gas that consists entirely of carbon dioxide and water vapours that can be captured relatively easily and can be stored safely in repositories deep underground. Moreover, He is working towards sustainable energy, environment, climate change and low carbon technologies. The main interests are in the conversion of renewable sources such as biomass, solar, wind and hydro into heat and power including their impact on the environment and climate change. He is also studying the combustion behaviour of different fossil fuels to get a better understanding of their environmental impacts. His expertises are in energy, heat and mass transfer operations, fluid mixing, distillation, energy optimisation, wastewater treatment, hydrogen production, fluidised bed combustion (FBC), life cycle assessment (LCA), oxy-fuel combustion, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling.","2018","Lecturer","Coventry University","https://www.linkedin.com/company/15492","http://www.coventry.ac.uk"," "," "," "," ","United Kingdom","Higher Education","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

Thereafter Jack spent several years working with the interiors division of the Macfarlane Group PLC based in Glasgow before eventually leading an MBO of this company. In 2000 Jack became a founding Director of 3FOLD who today offer independent FF&E services (furniture, fittings, and equipment) to companies and organisations who wish to procure new products (eg furniture. lighting, etc) and this involves the compiling and writing of tenders and evaluation matrices whilst working alongside their clients design teams and procurement people. The other major strand of 3FOLD work is in carrying out workplace audits and studies to ensure efficiency and cost effectiveness in the office environments.and support in addition to work studies and audits of office environments. He has worked closely with top FTSE companies, large multi national corporates, SME's, public and government bodies, and a wide range of charitable organisations. 3FOLD also offer comprehensive space planning to support the workplace studies and to demonstrate different ways of working. With his comprehensive sales background Jack has also been involved in sales training for a number of different and varied organisations.

I have always been fascinated with objects; how they are made, how they function and everything else surrounding them. This curiosity has led me on a path of design, originally training as a bespoke furniture maker and going on to study a masters degree in design & technology. I have since worked in a mix of design studios and companies across many different disciplines and projects, and for the past two and a half years worked from my own studio on a broad range of projects across multiple industries. I have a passion for design which has always driven my work, and driven me to push myself into new areas and experiences.  At the core of everything I do is a belief that design is centred around the way people live and interact with their surroundings. Focusing on the end user, understanding their needs and shaping the entire environment around them. The basis for my work stems from a hands-on understanding for materials and manufacturing, coupled with a knowledge of brand and retail, following the product from concept to consumer. I have always believed strongly in design being unobtrusive and ‚Äòas little design as possible‚Äô centred around function and how design can help people in many ways,resulting in functional and relevant design that works for everyone.

Sandra‚Äôs project expertise ranges from high-end retail, residential, restaurants, hospitality, historic buildings, as well as master planning in urban environments worldwide and within the UK.    Fluent in Spanish and English, Sandra studied architecture in the Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia, where she gained an insight in the architectural world. She continued her Architectural training in the Danish Royal Academy of Arts and it was in Denmark that she decided to pursue a career in lighting design, as the Danish sensibilities to light made her aware of its power to change and enhance architecture. At the start of her career, Sandra gained experience with a couple of engineering consultancies, which added a different perspective and another layer to her lighting skills through developing solutions integrating daylight and artificial lighting supporting sustainability.    Her interest in lighting design, took her to work with renowned lighting consultants, where she gained a well-rounded experience in many UK and international projects. These include hotels, restaurants, corporate offices, building exteriors, luxury residences and particularly high end retail, with clients like Louis Vuitton, Moncler, Celine and Burberry.  Her highest point in lighting was working for the Spanish bathroom company Roca, designing their London gallery with Zaha Hadid Architects. In this space, sinuous architecture and light fuses as one, providing the client with an iconic space where their high end products can be exhibited.

From city-wide strategies in the UK through to the delivery of award winning public realm in Australia, Michael‚Äôs experience demonstrates an innate ability to strategise a project, integrate stakeholder aspirations, and build lasting bonds and partnerships between disparate organisations and communities. A key part of his design journey has been my research into understanding the vital systems that combine to form a place. Through working on an array of complex projects in the UK, Australia, China and USA he has been able to discern these vital systems into a workable set of criteria that can be applied to any ‚Äòplace‚Äô. Referred to as ‚ÄòPlace Vitality Criteria‚Äô the criteria reveal a holistic set of nine systems that inter-relate with each other. This place focused ethos centred around community led regeneration has culminated in a number of recent International and Australian Urban Design, Landscape Architecture and Community Engagement awards for Parramatta City River, Byron Bay Town Centre Masterplan and Maitland High Street. All projects were large scale, environmentally constrained, highly significant to their local communities and subject to intense public scrutiny. Since moving back to the UK in 2016 Michael has embarked on a new challenge in establishing McGregor Coxall‚Äôs UK and European presence.

With my Main Driving Force being to Strive for Creativity and Originality. Addendum COVID 19 Companies needing simple product photographs can drop small scale items off at my home in Cheadle Hulme, where I can shoot them and deliver the image files online. My work is guaranteed. You don't pay if you are not happy, and you decide how much my work is worth. I aim to produce work for my clients which is special to them, as well as to keep my creative juices flowing with personal projects. I am particularly drawn to Aesthetic Beauty, Spontaneity, Emotions, Dance, Movement, Light and Shade. Having said that, much of my work involves straightforward photography for companies which need photos of their Staff, their Premises, and their Products. I pride myself in getting good results photographing people who say they hate having their photograph taken. Specialisms are many, including photography of People and Still-life for Advertising and Design; Fashion for Clothing Manufacturers; Food for Restaurants and Manufacturers; Prospectus photography for Schools and Colleges; Corporate Portraits; Lingerie; Sportswear; Family photography creating Sweet Memories of Bumps, Babies, Children, Teenagers and Adults as Couples and Singles.

I have many years' experience photographing Jewellery, and Underwater Babies, I shoot Events and Parties, Weddings in various styles to suit my clients' tastes. I shoot sensitive, discreet Boudoir and Nudes, including Calendars and Fine Art. I can light and photograph Interiors and Architectural Exteriors.

Taking influence from the Situationists, Artist Placement Group, Bauhaus, and Earthworks, I am interested in the transformative possibilities of collaborative practice in shaping place-based policy and planning service reform. Between 2018 and 2020 I undertook an extensive research period to examine the opportunities and limitations within the current UK planning system for planning policy and service reform. The research focussed on a number of key areas including collaborative design practice, health inequalities relating to areas of high deprivation, and importantly, how environmental planning can affect mental health and wellbeing. The research was supported through a placement with Birmingham City Council, and the findings will be explored through pilot activity that will explore community consultation methodologies and future opportunities through the devolution of decision-making processes. In addition to WERK I have held the following positions and memberships - former Art and Urbanism Specialist Panel Member for Birmingham Design and ‚Ä®Conservation Review Panel which consisted of appointed professionals who share expertise to independently and objectively assess key development proposals received by Birmingham City Council, Elected Fellow of Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce (RSA), which aims to enrich society through ideas and action, Member of Lighting Urban Community International (LUCI) a unique international network bringing together cities and lighting professionals engaged in using light as a major tool for sustainable urban, social and economic development and Visiting Lecturer in Cultural Planning, Art Policy, Stakeholder Theory for Birmingham City University.

Photography has been a passion for most of my life, from black and white film to the latest digital technology. IT and photography come together in interactive panoramas and virtual tours, the main business of my business, Harald Joergens Photography. Panoramas are a great marketing tool. They look cool on a website, they are much talked about on social media, and links to them are shared a lot. They are good for business. A panorama can contain an enormous amount of information. This information pops up when the viewer moves the cursor near an area of interest, so only the information the viewer is interested in does pop up. There is no information overload; the viewer is always in charge. Unlike watching a video, where the viewer can only stop and reverse or repeat a fixed sequence, a panorama leaves the viewer in total control - to move in any direction, to zoom in to inspect minute detail, to zoom out for an overview. A Virtual Tour combines two or more panoramas, allowing the viewer to 'walk through' a building, an aircraft, a ship, a golf course, it could be anything. There can me a map to help with navigation, and arrows lead from one panorama to the next. Panoramas work on almost all devices, from a smartphone to a power computer. When properly done, they load very quickly. A panorama puts the viewer into the centre of a scene. The viewer is actively in charge, not a passive consumer. That's why people love panoramas. And that makes them brilliant marketing tools.

Fraher Architects was founded in 2009 by myself and Lizzie, delivering small scale and award winning residential projects throughout London. Since then, our practice has grown in size and project scope, with the aim of constantly improving areas of our expertise, and where possible, beyond those boundaries, toward even broader fields. This has been achieved by consciously evolving our practice, and we've done this by placing learning, improving, and refining every aspect of what we do, at the very core of our business. This means being aware of opportunities as they arise, and being proactive in making positive change. Most visibly, it is this philosophy that led to our joining forces with Findlay Construction. We took repeated learnings from over a decade of practice, and saw that our most excellent work was realised through close relations, with our most excellent construction partners. To improve further therefore, we took the opportunity to evolve, and created our design and build offering.  But it doesn't just stop there. Like evolution, the process is ongoing and underpins everything that we do, both internally and externally. From internal projects and experiments (where we burden the risks and share the rewards), to staff development and training, to client relations and project management, to finding future partners and associates that share in our plans, to learn, improve, and refine.

With few of them I founded my own Engineering firm in 2000, which I left only in 2012.  After my Engineering firm experience, I started in Proger as Project Manager for two Projects in Iraq. Few months later, I was asked to follow in Riyadh (KSA) another project for the fit out of 34 storey high building. During this experience I helped the Branch to organize the starting business. We were challenged by the growing number of employees - we reached more than 1000 units - and the complexity of the organization management.  In six months I was Chief Operating Officer and at the end of 2016 I was appointed Branch Manager Deputy for the Riyadh Branch and Business Development Manager for the Middle East area.  In 2014 I founded with my brother Paolo Superstile Ltd, a London-based advisoring company in the field of development and management of real estate assets and infrastructure projects. In the same year Ultraspazio project was born - where I am founder and partner - our Turin coworking with a drive for internationalization, in a few years one of the most important realities in the sector at city level. Since 2018 I am also founder and partner of Samos CCP Ltd, a London consultancy and services company, which acts as a bridge between the Arab and the European world on real estate development and prop-tech. Samos recently closed an agreement with EXIM Finance in Dubai to follow the assessment of the projects and the subsequent phases of Project and Construction Management of the various initiatives promoted by the Emirate company all over the world with the contribution of the European Export Credit Agencies. I live between London, Turin and the countries where we have ongoing projects. I love Turin and I have built together with some business friends a spontaneous think tank which, feeling strong the desire and responsibility to guarantee our children and future generations the opportunity to live, grow and work in a prosperous territory open to Europe and in the world, it is scientifically investigating the deep dynamics related to the decline of the city by comparing them with other Italian and European cities. I have good relationship skills and four languages spoken and written (Italian, English, French and Spanish).","2017","President and Founder","SAMOS CCP S+D","https://www.linkedin.com/company/66889184","http://www.samos-sd.com"," "," "," ","_superstile_","London, England Metropolitan Area","Civic & Social Organization","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

Even after graduating as a fully fledged Cameraman/DoP, I made a conscious decision to start at the bottom of the ladder again within the industry to gain contacts, experience and especially that very special knowledge that Film Schools cannot give you. My passion for Photography and Film started after seeing that ground-breaking Cousteau film, Le Monde du Silence at the age of 9. Although barely touching or specialising in the underwater world, I was led on to a fascinating Career path in all the types of film/tv genres mentioned above visiting all the corners of the world and subsequently experiencing the huge range of differing lifestyles of the peoples of those places. I have a particular love and interest for Africa though, having been born in Morocco and travelled and worked fairly frequently in many of it‚Äôs countries. Of course my industry is forever changing not always for the better. Schedules are often tough and budgets ever decreasing. Demand for quality is a constant but maintaining it, is in my opinion, an ever-growing struggle.  But for those of us who, like myself, pride ourselves on producing the high standard of work required of us, often with few resources, the workplace is often tough. Our huge resources of experience over decades of practising our trade does count for everything.  At the end of a beautiful African day though,  I love what I do and can honestly say, I wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world!

I am very self-motivated, and confident at managing a varied portfolio ranging in complexity and scale, and capable of leading multi-disciplinary design teams for over 16 years in a variety of sectors such as Defence, Education, Healthcare, Residential and Commercial sectors.  I have extensive knowledge and experience of both UK and US Defence and Security related projects (mission, non-mission essential facilities, and maintenance works). These projects range from minor works at ¬£250k through to major projects ¬£10m+. My personal experience has given opportunities to work on a diverse range of schemes and commissions of some 200+ defence related projects. This has enabled me to gain a wide variety of experience in a multidisciplinary environment with key understanding of other disciplines to provide a unique understanding of project requirements.  This experience has also provided transferable skills to other sectors as most project typologies in the defence sector can be found outside of this sector. Therefore, I am able to review, design and manage residential developments, commercial projects, land opportunities, education, leisure and healthcare facilities from a very different perspective.   The defence sector requires a dedicated set of skills to manage a multi-disciplinary team to deliver a range of projects via a single source while balancing UK MoD and US DoD regulations in an environment with an ever changing mission. I have been responsible for developing a dedicated and bespoke defence team at Ingleton Wood to achieve this objective.  Ingleton Wood are unique in our offering and a willingness to deliver beyond contractual expectations to provide a cohesive and financially viable scheme. Our ethics focus on client delivery not just the statement of need.

My role here was to develop central in store creative guidelines for all of the stores, which meant I had to work closely with all teams in each store, to ensure a consistent brand vision across all. My remit also included the development of creative guidelines for display of Simon Carter products in key franchises and display units in stores such as Liberty, Fortnum & Masons and Selfridges. In addition to this, I was employed on a rolling contract basis at Guinevere Interiors on the Kings Road for nine years, from 2004-2013, and had sole responsibility for the development of all window and interior displays, which were updated monthly.

I believe that the process of making architecture is equally important as the resulting artefact, and actively encourage participation, experimentation and diversity to create an architecture which is appropriate to it's place and users, and is able to adapt, evolve and age gracefully in balance with it's context. Our primary architectural aspiration at DO is to create new buildings and spaces, and to re-model the existing built environment, however we also take up the challenge of reacting to man-made environments and spaces that have been created, altered, deposited or abandoned by others, and for this we use illumination and intervention. In my career to date I have worked on a range of high profile residential projects, from large-scale social and private developments to smaller bespoke projects, while also gaining extensive experience in cultural, healthcare and commercial work, most notably helping roll out the Fopp brand across the UK.","2005","Owner and Director","DO-Architecture","https://www.linkedin.com/company/18312490","http://www.do-architecture.co.uk/"," "," "," ","DO_Architecture","Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom","Architecture & Planning","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

Our location means that we can keep overheads low so that we can offer very cost effective support for our clients.  We don‚Äôt believe in publicity for publicity‚Äôs sake. We design and implement marketing campaigns that help our clients educate, inform and engage their audiences, challenge perceptions and change behaviour, build brands and businesses and create and protect reputations. We will and are able to turn our hand to most things, although by virtue of the expertise within the company, we have a good deal of experience in the construction sector. A good proportion of clients are in the manufacture and distribution of building products, from roofing market leader, SIG Design & Technology to global lighting manufacturer, Aurora.

I've filmed in locations as far flung as Yellowstone National Park and Death Valley, Uganda and Vietnam, the Bahamas and Russia.  As a self-shooter, with a deep-rooted consideration of the planet and its inhabitants, I have interspersed my career with creating thoughtful short-form content on subjects ranging from climate change, sustainable living, homeless & orphaned children, AIDS, vaccinations, eco-fashion, community gardens and people with learning difficulties. I strive to seek out engaging stories that entertain as well as inform the viewer, and source and secure key contributors through creativity and enthusiasm, combined with energy and compassion. Exceptionally organised and dedicated, I work hard as part of a team to deliver quality and engaging content. Graduating with a degree in architecture has given me a background in design, as well as the theory and psychology of how people engage with the space around them. Combined with a love of gardening and interior design, this informs the way I interact with our world, as I strive to create a balance between the natural world and its inhabitants.

My lighting design portfolio boasts some of the UK's most iconic roads, from Marble Arch and Hyde Park Corner to Park Lane (where I was the first to use the Philips Cosmo lamp on the Transport for London Road Network).

My friends and coworkers could tell you I am truly passionate about my work and new technologies in general, and I am always willing to learn more or speak about the lighting industry and its trends. While I enjoyed all the different aspects of my job, my favourite part of being a lighting designer/engineer is when every aspect of a project needs to be looked at from the first brief with the customer to the final installation. I am always interested in hearing from others in the industry, so feel free to contact me if you would like to connect.

Freshly out of university, I was head-hunted by ONZO which was at the time working on Smart Home technologies. Following that experience I freelanced for companies such as Hulger/Plumen, Keechdesign and Sculptivate, broadening my field of expertise. As I progressed through my career, I joined consultancies like SeymourPowell and JDO where I had the opportunity to focus on conceptual and innovation work and further my knowledge of the industry. Having gained this valuable experience through working for established brands like Dove, Unilever, Citroen, Nissan, Playstation, Yamaha, LG, Barclays, Heinz, PepsiCo and Budweiser on 3D brand experience, I felt the need to explore other options to deepen my understanding of production methods and manufacturing processes.  Over the last 12 years of experience in different fields of design, allowed me to successfully launch over 30 products to the market so far, with many more in the earlier stages of creation. I am now feeling confident handling a project from the research and concept stages up to the final stages of production. My unique path also allowed me to develop as a project manager as well as getting a vast knowledge of production methods, materials and assembly options.","2020","Senior Industrial Designer","Zwift","https://www.linkedin.com/company/5233302","http://www.zwift.com"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

With several years of experience, I work continuously to keep up to date in a fast-paced environment, and always try to understand the bigger picture. I can then use my excellent communication skills, imagination and adaptability to continuously develop successful projects, provide technical design support and solve problems.  A goal-oriented and self-motivated individual, I have extensive experience of directing design, quality and planning requirements, process re-engineering, motivating staff, and providing instruction. With the ability to see the technical and regulatory needs, I drive change and achieve results. I greatly enjoy working on my own initiative, or as part of a team, and I am especially proud that I always demonstrate the high levels of motivation required to meet critical deadlines. Even under significant pressure, I will perform safely and to the best of my abilities, at all times. Designing electronic engineering plans, procedures, and methods, on a regular basis I oversee the execution of field work and respond to issues, ensuring overall compliance with company and industry standards. I have a detailed understanding of project development and management, throughout my career I have consistently impressed business leaders with my ability to deliver results. Directing teams and helping others grow and develop to their full potential is something I am passionate about, and is reflected in the way I go beyond what is required to train team members.

Having acquired countless transferrable skills and a real understanding of the importance of fine details, I pursued a career in sales. This started well as I was managing a small team of five in a field sales role for Executive Client Acquisitions; unfortunately I gave up this role for personal reasons in November 2016 which led to my taking a role working for Eaton Lighting. Whilst working as a Telesales Advisor at Eaton I developed significantly and I gained priceless experience in several areas. From customer service and rejection handling to becoming proficient with lighting design software, I expanded my professional capabilities immeasurably; this continued further within my second job with Eaton, where I worked in a technical support role as Eaton‚Äôs sole Technical Advisor in Doncaster. I then worked with Sheffield Hallam University within the Venture Matrix team, a team which gave students the opportunity to put theory into practice through real life projects which are also accredited as part of their degree. In turn these projects provided organisations with access to the specialist skills, knowledge and insights of Sheffield Hallam's students with no associated costs. I am now working in the Lighting Design team at BELL Lighting, using Relux design software and AutoCAD to produce lighting schemes for a variety of applications. Outside of my working life I also get involved in fundraising for various charities; most notably I raised ¬£2,500 for Cats Protection by completing the Brighton (2018) and London (2019) marathons.","2020","Lighting Engineer","BELL Lighting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2644108","http://www.belllighting.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","United Kingdom","Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

I have enjoyed taking on various roles from Event and Production Management, Project Management, Stage Management, Client Management, to backstage stage crew, FOH audience handling, security cash control, crew booking, and as Director for 12 years running my own business, and with it Management of Staff, Accounting, Purchasing, Operations so I guess I have a wealth of skills and contacts to help you create amazing events and point you in the right direction. Always the one with a smile on my face loading trucks in -5 degrees, coiling 63Amp 3phase cables in muddy fields, Stage Managing 300 children, or evacuating an airport at 2am for a security scare, I truly love a challenge.  I adore the entertainment industry, the amazing creative people within it, love technology and working with young bands to encourage them into the fabulous industry we all love. Do connect with me if you can utilise my skill base or would like to discuss future projects that we can assist with at www.4Wall.com across the whole of the entertainment industry, UK, USA & Europe.","2020","Director, Business Consultant, Production Manager","Grazity Ltd"," "," "," "," "," "," ","United Kingdom","Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

Supplying electrical products, including Fire and security, in a very competitive market demands considerable product knowledge, determination , understanding of customer needs and flair to encourage customers to buy from me (and the company I work for) rather than the competition. Living in Surbiton I am ideally positioned to cover London and the South East. From 1989 until 2003 I sold the full range of electrical products as an employee of electrical wholesalers. During the period I was performed the roles of Commercial Manager and Branch Manager. Since 2003 I have performed the role of Area Sales Manager in the Fire and Security Market, designing , quoting and selling Fire alarm systems, emergency lighting, CCTV and door access equipment. I am qualified in the design of fire alarm systems to BS5839 Part1, 2013 and emergency lighting to BS5266.  I have added CCTV and door access to my skill set, advising end clients and installers on systems to suit their requirements. This has included on site product demonstration at schools, factory's ,commercial and industrial properties. Since 2016 i have returned to the Electrical Wholesale market , joining a Large independent distributor with 23 branches which is growing in excess of the competition as a whole.  I have grown sales year on year in every sales role i have undertaken achieving  this through understanding customer needs and providing high quality service.

I enjoy learning new skills and acquiring information to benefit whatever task or job I am undertaking.I work very well with others on a professional level, am confident leading a team and have experience in running and organising large long running projects. Most of my current and recent work has been the involvement of large domestic or commercial refurbishment of electrical installations to a high professional standard. Most notably, the refurbishment of the iconic Camden stables market abandoned horse hospital which was transformed into modern luxury office space. I was one of two electrical foremen on the project - our roles consisted of time and project management, man management of 25 plus electricians, liaising with design teams and architects, problem solving, design and technical insight throughout the project and the organisation of materials, deliveries and disposals. I am very proficient in my current employment yet wish to learn more within the realm of home automation, namely Lutron as my main interest in my current profession is the lighting and it‚Äôs control. I also have a deep interest in lighting design and would love the opportunity to advance my understanding and experience within this field. I find the impact that both natural and decorative lighting can have on a space very interesting. I am computer literate and wish to learn more about data networking and the programming aspects that coincide with home automation and lighting, seeing myself hopefully in a position in the future as a lighting designer, commissioner of programming software or project manager.","2018","Field Service Engineer","Lutron Electronics","https://www.linkedin.com/company/8817","http://www.lutron.com"," "," "," "," ","Waltham Abbey, England, United Kingdom","Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

After receiving a first-class honour degree, she was awarded the Gilbertson's Excellence Scholarship, which paid for her to continue her studies at Masters level at the university. After completing her Masters, she moved to London to pursue a career in lighting and completed a Certificate Course in Lighting Design and Application from the Lighting Industry Association. Karen believes lighting brings both an emotional as well as practical value to architecture‚Äì it can help create a positive ambience and experience for those who occupy the space. Whether it's daylighting or artificial lighting, light draws attention to textures, colours, and forms a space, helping architecture achieve its true purpose. Before joining Troup Bywaters + Anders, Karen had gained valuable experience working with established lighting design companies in London. She brings her knowledge to the studio across all levels of a project; from developing concepts that are innovative and exciting, to working up detailed design packages that ensure these concepts are realized effectively. Her portfolio includes many UK and international projects such as high-end residences, hospitality, superyachts and retail. Karen is also actively involved in the lighting community, writing articles for magazines, contributing to light installation competitions and speaking at design events. She also has Affiliate Membership with both the Institution of Lighting Professionals and the CIBSE Society of Light and Lighting.

I work on historically sensitive and high profile projects with interior designers, architects and interpretive designers to realise integrated and branded lighting schemes. Lighting control design and commissioning play an important role and working with the client to set scenes through light in a projects final moment is one of the highlights of this role. Along with a good eye for design and an understanding of light and the associated technology; lighting calculations, visualisations, renderings, animations, project management, cost analysis, detailed specification and good working relationships form the backbone of successful projects. Recent awards- Spectrum House, Glasgow: Winner of Workplace category at Lighting Awards 2013 Westminster Abbey Cellarium Cafe, London: Shortlisted for the Lighting Design Awards 2014 During my MA in design I gained valuable interpretive and interior design and experiential design skills working in an industry placement with Ben Dawson Furniture .

If we haven‚Äôt met yet, let me tell you briefly who I am and why I am here‚ú® I am a London-based multidisciplinary designer, fascinated by the interaction of light with space, people, and emotions. I have been part of a variety of international projects from stage lighting design to event lighting, private parties, high-end brand presentations, and public art installations to mention a few. My personal objective on every project is to create ùó∫ùóÆùó¥ùó∂ùó∞ùóÆùóπ, ùó∂ùó∫ùó∫ùó≤ùóøùòÄùó∂ùòÉùó≤, ùóÆùóªùó± ùó∫ùòÇùóπùòÅùó∂-ùòÄùó≤ùóªùòÄùóºùóøùòÜ ùó≤ùòÖùóΩùó≤ùóøùó∂ùó≤ùóªùó∞ùó≤ùòÄ. Creating experiences for people to discover how Light has this magical power to stimulate our emotions and the spaces that surround us, was what inspired me to research Light as a Medium of Communication in Urban Spaces for my MSc dissertation.  One of my favorite projects has been my collaboration with the Urban Electric team and German Ermics commissioned by Instagram, ‚ÄúWhere the Rainbow Ends‚Äù, for which we received a [d]arc Best Light Art Scheme - High Budget award.‚ú® When I am not designing or experimenting with light, I am sharing my lighting knowledge, passion, and inspiration through my brand Archifos with the mission to raise awareness about the importance of well-designed light in everyday life. I've been participating in international speaking engagements, panels, conferences, and events, and, currently, I am focusing further on online speaking interactions. Currently, I've been collaborating with Light Collective and Formalighting, curating, and managing the social media channels for the Women in Lighting project.

Hughes College of Engineering at University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), receiving a BSc in Electrical and Electronic engineering and completing FE/EIT certification to become a nationally registered Engineering Intern in the US. Serving as both an intern and electrical designer at G.C. Wallace, Inc., Las Vegas, an avid and focused interest in lighting was developed.  Experiences included a variety of land development projects which began as infrastructure and masterplanning projects that trended toward commercial and architectural illumination, before moving to the UK and training/working as a lighting specialist with AECOM. Over time, a strong connection was made with the importance of integrating natural lighting for health and sustainability as well as low-impacting to sensitive ecosystems into the built environment. This includes both architectural integration as well as combining what is naturally or artificially available, day or night, within a lighting design. Integrated design projects covered a variety of diverse locations including the United States, United Kingdom and locations within the Middle East.  Watching the way people interact with their enviroment, there is a great deal of importance with respect to first impressions and long-term opinions people have of their environments. There is no doubt that there are lighting solutions which enhance a person‚Äôs response to the built environment, regardless of the structure, climate or purpose. Particular project experience in the use of natural and artificial lighting of architecture, the public realm, galleries, schools, landscape and roadways. Related projects include daylight modelling and design, overshadowing assessments and night-time lighting impact strategies.","2006","Associate Director, Lighting","AECOM (incorporating Davis Langdon, An AECOM Company)","https://www.linkedin.com/company/163371","http://www.aecom.com"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Design","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

I moved to Kent, and worked in an Admin role at a big American Manufacturing Plant where I was swiftly promoted to Purchasing Manager, I got a Degree in Purchasing.     Some girlfriends, (electricians), suggested that I should become an electrician.  I laughed, but started to take the whole idea seriously.     I undertook College 3+ years,  2x nights a week. I got made redundant from Purchasing, the enthusiasm & opportunity was there to build up a small Electrical Company.    19 years later I am still working with some of my Original customers,  + I have a team of Fantastic Expert Friendly Electricians.    I still work out in the field, working with my electricians, but also visiting customers to provide surveys, and often at night covering emergency callouts.  ~CONTACT ME: Feel free to contact me at karen@brightsparkelectrician, or by connecting here at Linkedin.

As 100% of the design and manufacturing work is carried out in-house, our products are fully customisable to fit any project design brief. Element One are the originators of the motorised monitor screen, and although copied by some, our award-winning products still hold several key patents and unique design features, including the use of two whisper-quiet and precise stepper motors in each screen. Our products are also best in class for quietness, power consumption and weight and come with a five year warranty. Our simple ethos being to combine the highest quality materials available, with the most sleek and ergonomic designs to create the best motorised screens money can buy. Some of the various applications for our screens include conference, training & board rooms, presentation areas, sales and consulting spaces, reception & concierge desks and point of sale. Although predominantly used for video conferencing and boardroom applications, Element One products can be used in any environment, and are particularly practical if a space wasting LCD monitor with all its cables and connections can be replaced with a discreet and space saving motorised screen that can be hidden away inside a desk when not in use. As well as Element One products being ascetically pleasing and user friendly, our company's uncompromising design philosophy incorporates the need for all products to have a low overall power consumption and be free from pollutants.

It all began before I was two when they built me a new kind of powerchair to give me the same level of mobility as other children at that stage: to free me first to be a toddler, so that each developmental step was right there ahead to seize throughout my childhood. They succeeded. I was 'The Wheelchair Toddler'. I am now passionate about making sure that that is still available to every disabled child born now. No patronising compromise. I meet parents who, like my own parents way back when, are not ready to give up their dreams and ambitions for their child just yet. Dragonmobility's vision is to see every disabled person fully integrated in the mainstream world in a practical way.  I don't think there's any experience I've had in my education and career that I don't call upon in my current work. I use my law degree and my corporate finance experience as much as I use my child development GCSE! Running an engineering workshop is much like my theatre production days - it's about bringing everything together behind the scenes to create exquisite moments of joy. We are a not-for-profit which competes with large international corporations; we know every child by name and build them a machine that fits with their (often quite tricky) body, and we provide the expertise of over 30 years to their parents to make that work and keep it working as they grow. We are looking to the child's future: not a medicalised future, but a life and a career and a family and all the things those parents always dreamed of. We need the support of the people who also believe in children's futures.

In all I do I strive to deliver way past my clients expectations in a cost they can afford, delivered in a time that they require. That‚Äôs why I innovated the way we do business to maximise the solutions we can bring to my forward thinking clients.

One of the reasons I've stayed within telecoms for so long is because I enjoy watching businesses grow and thrive once they realise they're no longer tied to a telephone line! The degree of flexibility it offers means they can run their companies from anywhere, take their office landline number to any destination, and have fast and efficient broadband connectivity at the location of their choosing. Telecoms World Plc has 5 Stars on Trustpilot from over 1000 reviews. It's a record we're all proud of and determined to maintain.  As a proactive person, I enjoy developing long-term relationships with clients to ensure we can provide them with the connectivity solutions they need as their businesses grow, keeping them abreast of new products available which may be of help to them. One of the key projects of late has been the complex process of moving a number of NHS contact centres into the cloud to allow them to operate remotely. We achieved this in record time, taking the stress of the situation off the shoulders of the NHS management team and providing them with the support required to get them fully functioning from home.  We provide leading solutions in the telecoms field and apply them innovatively to real-world challenges so our customers get the service they need - fast. In addition to helping the NHS, we've also provided international telephony solutions for major charities, holiday companies and large UK-based enterprises. I remind myself every day of some sound advice from an old mentor: KISS - Keep it simple stupid! It's held me in good stead and I'm determined to ensure all my clients receive the simplest solution for their requirements.

With the ability to work across a project, to deliver a completed infrastructure on time and within its financial constraints.  Having served various principle, and sub-contractors at various levels including: technical services manager, project engineer, e & p supervisor, mep supervisor, lead engineer & site manager.  I have a working knowledge of various different contracts used within the construction and rail industries. I am a firm believer in risk and de risk management, having the ability to avert risk within a program by pre empting possible issues, and minimising mistakes.  I have a flexible attitude towards a project and I am used to collaborative working, between the project team and the people on the floor. A slight bias towards the commercial and asset management side of the project, helps to ensure that hand over happens the first time. I have ability to identify the correct requirements over the assumed, and regularly check against the scope and/or relevant standards, to gain the facts over what people think are required. Usually saving the project both time and money. I utilise my broad knowledge to ensure a project is built correctly the first time, thus preventing non-compliant systems being built with costly delays to the client. I am willing to learn from others and find new systems, and find a challenge not to be looked away from. I find the ability to be dropped into a work site and be up and running very quickly, a positive in the current working environment. I have a varied IT skills base, am experienced in various Microsoft systems, and have the ability to read programs on both project and primavera.","2020","Resident Engineer & Design Manager","Future-tech","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1542617","https://www.future-tech.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Construction","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

If you're optimising the sound of your product, you can see instantly where annoying frequencies are coming from. If you want to avoid production downtime, you can see exactly which bearings or components are worn, and plan your preventative maintenance. Save energy costs by finding compressed air leaks instantly. Instantly see sources of squeaks and rattles, wind noise, road noise, workplace noise... The SOUNDCAM is the world's first fully portable, splash-proof, battery-powered acoustic-imaging camera. Like thermal imaging but for sound, the SOUNDCAM locates sound sources in real-time superimposed on a video picture.  Previously this revolutionary technology came in the form of complex and fragile hardware and software for experts. Coming on the market in early 2019, the SoundCam is the only acoustic camera that is truly portable and robust, and which anyone can learn to use in 5 minutes.  With 64 microphones measuring at 48kHz, and 100 frames/sec of acoustic pictures, it has pinpoint accuracy and speed that very few can match, for a fraction of the price of other systems.  Priced at ‚Ç¨8k, it is rapidly becoming part of the standard toolkit for anyone working with acoustic issues. This is mind-blowing, game-changing high-tech that anyone can use! For the acoustic experts, we also have the modular BIONIC series of acoustic cameras, with advanced specifications and prices that nobody can come close to.  We also offer rental, and consulting services. With this incredible technology, we can solve your noise problems faster than anyone else!

The advice of a hired-hand is not always appreciated in the boardroom, but skin-in-the-game is much more reassuring to founders and investors, so in appropriate circumstances DevelAngel, as the equity-stake development function of uPBeat, co-invests to help make the product happen.

There is no technical bar today to stop 'quality consumer' equipment from approaching or even excelling genuine Professional Audio levels with very careful design.

A recent example is a multi-channel dimmable DC LED lighting system intended for studio and commercial/industrial applications requiring low EMI and where the high efficiency and long life of LED luminaires saves on energy and the maintenance involved with replacing halogen bulbs. The absence of AC currents & voltages at either 50/60 Hz which may be phase controlled or high frequency AC from moderm 'electronic transformers' improves the EMC of the studio and control room. Enquiries welcome. Just click on the blue logo below to connect.

As managing director of an approved supplier to the engineering industry, I guarantee Coleherne Ltd offer the highest standards of quality & technical advice to all our customers.  Our operators are qualified to ASNT level 2. Strict quality assurance & inspection procedures are applied to all our manufacturing activities complying with our ISO9001 BSI registration. In 1991 we introduced laser cutting precision to the manufacturing of component products. Every part in a rotating equipment needs to meet the recommended specs for it to work efficiently.   Part of my role as managing director is the technical development of industrial bearings & bearing design for which we use the latest CAD/CAM facilities.  The technical advice we offer is based on computerised performance data calculations ‚Äì as precise & reliable as the industrial bearing used in rotating equipment. As Coleherne Ltd‚Äôs managing director I am responsible for technical advice & sales development.  The high standard of our technical advice is a major factor in our sole agency agreement with Kingsbury Inc. technological leaders in the field of fluid film thrust & journal bearings used in rotating equipment.  This link has increased our sales of industrial bearings to the European engineering sector.

Design is a passion I have been honing for years, and I am very grateful that I am able to practice it professionally. A well planned interior can add value to a property in many ways, from creating a relaxing environment for customers, to portraying the accurate image of a corporation. Throughout years of training at prestigious art schools and universities, in addition to working at top design firms, I have developed design skills in the fields: ‚ñ∫ Retail ‚ñ∫ Commercial ‚ñ∫ Hospitality ‚ñ∫ Residential Having worked with many architectural practices, I have a keen sense of spatial awareness, which is a strong factor in the way I approach projects.  Clear and uncluttered, my designs are simple and effective. I have joined the LinkedIn community to reach out to property developers and commercial asset managers, who are looking to add value to their portfolio. I grew up far away from London, on the beautiful island of Bermuda!

Eden Electronics develop embedded software for OEMs systems mainly mainly in instrumentation and control and  bespoke tester equipment for companies who require a tester tailored to their needs.  We do design electronics when appropriate but also work with partners. I made my first 6502 based computer using a bag of electronic components and a soldering iron back in 1978 and have been in the Electronics/Computing/Telecoms industry ever since. Being both an Electronics Design Engineer and a Software Developer I love the embedded market where being trained in both is a real asset. I now use ARM processors on new designs, ARM Cortex M0, M3, M4 and have older systems that use ARM7, PXA270 and PXA320. I do still support customers who use 8051 and C166 processors, as I think it is important to offer long term support to customers. I like photography, and used to develop my own film and prints at University but have now gone digital using a Nikon D200 and the smaller Coolpix P7700. I like the country side; there is one advantage of visiting the in-laws who live in the English Lake District because it gives me an opportunity to get out on the fells, and combine walking and photography. My dream is to retire onto a Narrowboat and spend 365 days a year cruising the English canal system and visiting different towns throughout the country.

Aug. 2012 ‚Äì Aug 2013; finalised the development of our super low-cost gas generation technology. Our modular system can produce hydrogen from 1kg/day up to tons per day for infrastructure and utility company projects, at a fraction of the capital cost normally associated with such technologies. With system efficiencies at around 70%, we have designs for small and large-scale vehicle refuelling and fuel supplementation applications that are highly cost-competitive, efficient and robust. In addition to this, we are working with German manufacturing and distribution companies to finalise the development of a sealing system for use with high-pressure hydrogen, in a drive to eliminate the leaks and associated product gas losses which typically plague our industry wherever valves, sensors and gauges are installed. My goals for the future are to maintain the pressure I have always applied to the improvement of our understanding of technologies, to improve those technologies with which I come into contact, and to create a highly profitable corporate structure based on sound engineering and an understanding of its applications in a changing world economy. To transfer my considerable experience to my team and help develop their careers to the fullest extent possible. Specialties: Financial negotiations with banks, investors and shareholders.

From being a child I was drawn to anything mechanical (especially how to fix it) and I initially started my working life in the motor vehicle industry; working as a Tool Setter for MG Rover. Eventually it was here were I first experienced the buzz of finding engineering solutions through repairing and maintaining carousel lines to keep the assembly production lines going. I knew I had found my career direction.   Joining Aggregate Industries UK Limited nineteen years ago changed my career direction and my life. Throughout the seven years I worked for Aggregate Industries I did every job possible and was trained as an engineer; and in all aspects of Asphalt production and maintenance. The dedication and passion I put into my training and work led me through a number of promotions until I was finally promoted to Head of Plant Maintenance. I took the opportunity to become Director of Operations with Q&A Site Services Limited which enabled me to push my engineering and business skills further. It was here were I was responsible for overseeing and managing large scale projects for a number of blue chip companies; for example, building Mobile Satellite Asphalt Plants for Benninghoven (UK) Ltd, Leicester.  I valued my time at Q&A Site Services but due to personal circumstances I needed to find something that would allow me to stay a little closer to home. Whilst at Q&A Site Services I became involved and responsible for part of the sales department. Here I found a strong skill I did not realise I had, along with my skills and abilities of being a director I successfully secured my position of Sales Director with MME Ltd. (Manufacturing and Maintenance Engineering Limited). With MME Ltd I was able to maintain my engineering skills whilst meeting like-minded clients who needed creative and innovative solutions to their problems.

I‚Äôve found myself creating in many different ways, from building brands and websites to curating events, retreats and experiences. I worked as a freelance creative and consultant in London until a few years ago when I took a career break. I loved to create, to build brands and to bring stories and ideas to life, but something was missing for me. I decided to spend some time reconnecting with my passions and finding the parts of my job that I loved the most, I realised that I missed connecting with people and being able to spend time outdoors in nature. During this time I focused on doing the things that bought me happiness, travel, time with friends and family, time outdoors and time spent on self healing and self development. I re-discovered my passion for yoga and decided to pursue a path training as a yoga instructor. Focusing on my wellness and wellbeing has become a non-negotiable part of my daily routine. Every day I take time out for my mental health through daily meditation and breath-work practice and I make time to move my body. I love doing sports that allow me to be outside, surrounded by nature, and over the years I have developed quite a passion for sliding sideways, be it on a snowboard, surfboard or wakeboard. I live in the mountains in the winters and by the sea in the summers, this seasonal lifestyle means I get to travel, do the sports I love and meet inspiring people. I provide my clients with a range of design and movement services in various different ways, Through creative coaching and consultancy I help bring brands and ideas to life and through retreats, workshops and 1-2-1 yoga and mediation sessions I help my clients to integrate wellness methods into their everyday life to improve wellbeing and enhance work performance  I‚Äôve worked with most of my clients from the very start of their journey, helping to bring thier idea to life, giving it shape and helping it to grow into a lifelong passion project. I work in the industries I am passionate about and my clients include; yoga studios, adventure travel brands, ski chalets, ethical clothing brands, snowsports schools and surf retreats to name a few. In addition to working side by side with my clients for many years, I have created several business of my own, a retreat company, MVMT Retreats, a yoga studio, Powder Yoga and a children‚Äôs mindfulness brand, The Feelies. I bring my years of experience from all of these endeavours to every project to help you build and grow your business.","2020","Owner","Powder Yoga","https://www.linkedin.com/company/65730373","https://www.powderyoga.com"," "," "," ","CharlieDaviesUK","London, England, United Kingdom","Design","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

At least, that's what I studied in Oxford back in the days of flares, prog rock and visions of a better world. Maybe I would have been had I spent less time touring with bands and more time submerged in my studies. But music won and the 1970's were spent building large PA rigs and doing tour production for the likes of Selecter, The Beat and Haircut 100.  Fate intervened once more in 1980 and a period spent managing Roy Harper and launching his record label were followed by a decade at the sharp end of what was then a record industry, managing bands and producers and doing A+R consultancy for the likes of A+M, CBS, MCA and others.  Like all music professionals, part of my accreditation was the Virgin Records rip-off, leading to a nasty legal quagmire feathering the nests of slick lawyers and an accompanying dissillusionment with the record industry but not with music. Refocused if not yet entirely re-energised I returned to recording my own music in the early 1990's, and within the context of assembling my own modest recording rig I found myself sourcing juicy bits of equipment for friends and acquaintances in the industry. As so often in my past, an accidental adjunct to the main event turned into the main event itself and the rest is history. A monster with three heads, Funky Junk now operates from London, Paris and Milan meaning (if nothing else) that I get the occasional good meal and frequent good company.

Spending his spare time listening to and recording his friends playing live in the 1960s, Julian found that playback on his system at home fell woefully short of the experience he craved. Not content with second best, he decided to design his own amplifiers and loudspeakers, ignoring accepted wisdom and focusing on aspects of performance that made music burst to life. These first designs laid the foundations for a range of iconic and award-winning hi-fi products that would reach well into the next century. This maverick approach to design, backed by 40 years of engineering and craft, fuels our progress today. Choose Naim to go deeper into your music, for a completely immersive and involving listening experience.","1973","Manufacturer","Naim Audio Ltd","https://www.linkedin.com/company/453930","http://www.naimaudio.com"," "," "," ","NaimAudio","Salisbury, England, United Kingdom","Consumer Electronics","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

After arriving at University it didn't take me long before I actually did it. I had just turned 19 when I achieved my first jump and was uni club captain by 20.  I was determined to keep going until I no longer felt hopelessly scared, and I did! Now I've learnt to acknowledge and befriend that fear to help improve performance and enjoy it more! Not to mention the sense of achievement it gives. I persevered and overcame fears with a positive outlook all while leading others to do the same.  Having left university, I'm using this mantra for my professional life too. If you'd like to know more about me or how to manage fears then fire me a message!","2017","Product Design Engineer","Linn Products Ltd","https://www.linkedin.com/company/514171","http://www.linn.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","Greater Glasgow Area","Design","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

I started my career as a jointing planner, leasing with local authorities and developers to provided electrical connections to new street lighting assets. I then moved into fault repairs to understanding the different elements of street lighting asset. This experience has given me a great insight into various different components that can fail and who to diagnose the fault. From here I moved into road opening notices and safe digging procedures, where I have had the chance to fill in as a supervisor when the business required and complete traffic management drawings. I was then given an opportunity to learn the principles of lighting design, cable calculations and eventually onto project management of multiple projects. It would be fair to say I have rounded knowledge of the street lighting business, however I still very eager to learn more about this every changing industry.","2019","Street Lighting Design Engineer","M-EC Consulting Development Engineers","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1013028","http://www.m-ec.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","Greater Leicester Area","Public Safety","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

In 2011, I joined Triumph Motorcycles at the later stages of the Tiger Explorer project. This was a test and development role, on road mileage accumulation. In 2012, I joined a team developing a low capacity motorcycle for the Asian market, responsible for wheel concept design and braking systems. Although this bike never saw the light of day, I learned invaluable lessons in low cost, high volume manufacturing processes. In 2014, I began working on the Bonneville Bobber, where I: - Adapted the rear wheel & brakes designs to suit the caged swingarm - Developed the fabricated swingarm mounted rear mudguard & ancillaries. In 2016, I was promoted to Project Engineer, increasing my responsibilities to: - Manage junior team member‚Äôs workloads - Approve prototype designs - Attending quality and procurement reviews, and design change meetings In 2017, I began working on the MY2021 SPEED TRIPLE 1200 at concept, developing into a role as Project Engineer on brakes, wheels, suspension and swingarm, with a small sub team. I also worked as Chassis Liaison with Triumph‚Äôs development dept, which broadened my knowledge in motorcycle geometry and suspension development. In June 2020, I took voluntary redundancy from Triumph, and soon after I secured a role with Norton Motorcycles as a Senior Design Engineer. A varied role, overseeing Mileage accumulation testing, while developing test processes. This role also includes component ownership of all carbon fibre bodywork and the carbon fibre fuel tank, providing me the opportunity to learn more about the carbon fibre process while improving quality of the parts where possible. I am also gaining experience using the A3 PPS practical problem solving methodology and technique to efficiently root cause a problem. Further to this, I was involved with re-structuring the CAD system to integrate with CREO Windchill as part of the engineering department process improvement, drawing on my previous experience with these systems.

I believe my time at Loughborough has given me a broad range of design , engineering and management knowledge that I can apply to any situation. I am passionate about my work and always eager to improve my knowledge of design and manufacturing processes. My favourite part of the job is developing new products from concept to manufacture to solve a problem, or take advantage of an opportunity. The design process is extremely rewarding when ideas can be rapidly prototyped and reviewed in the flesh in a matter of days. I am very interested in using my knowledge to improve the lives of others through collaborative innovative design with other creative individuals, so feel free to contact me if you would like to connect.","2019","Senior Design Engineer - Chassis","Triumph Motorcycles Limited","https://www.linkedin.com/company/367241","http://www.triumphmotorcycles.com"," "," "," "," ","Leicester, England, United Kingdom","Automotive","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

Several years ago I started out as a contract ‚ÄòCAD Engineer‚Äô and since have worked on predominantly medium to heavy engineering projects, Steel works, Power Plants, Chemical Plants, but also on smaller special purpose machinery design projects as well. In 2007 I started working through my Company ‚ÄòSubtrakt Ltd‚Äô and have worked on that basis ever since. The work I undertake covers all aspects of engineering, usually undertaking project based work incorporating the design and creation of 3D CAD models to then produce detailed drawings for manufacture and assembly. I am knowledgeable in many CAD packages including: Solidworks, Solid Edge, Inventor & AutoCAD all of which I have used for many years. In addition to my skills in CAD and my overall sound engineering knowledge, I have also a high aptitude for all aspects of Project Management which has enabled me to run integral project related tasks, and on occasion managing a team of engineers on mechanical completion of relatively large scale projects.","2007","Owner","Subtrakt Limited"," "," "," "," "," "," ","Launceston, England, United Kingdom","Mechanical or Industrial Engineering","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

Aim:   To design and manufacture making use of modern technology and well trained human hands to ensure a high standard of build & finish quality is achieved while maximizing production efficiency and reducing costs. Strengths:   A well versed and innovative approach to design that has been built from the ground up, since childhood I have had an insatiable appetite for making things and by doing so have learned through hands on experience and observation. Time spent at Art school provided me with the opportunity to define my field and gain fundamental understanding of design theory. Armed with an aesthetic eye and a broad knowledge of 3 dimensional construction I have the right foundation to contribute to and realise a broad range of design briefs.     The ability to make the best use of the resources available, since the early stages of my professional career I have travelled with jobs, within the UK and internationally, from installs in corporate HQ‚Äôs  in the City of London to interactive retail environments in China.  Over the last ten years I have worked on installations across most of Western Europe, The Middle East & Gulf states, China, South East Asia & America. As things are rarely quite as you would like them to be (a particular feature of working on-site & overseas) one builds on making use of availiable resources by being flexible and open minded.   A base understanding and genuine concern regarding project budget, having worked on projects with budgets ranging from a few hundred pounds to hundreds of thousands  I have come to be acutely aware of hidden & accelerated costs.","2016","Director","Symmetry Studios Ltd","https://www.linkedin.com/company/11159543","http://www.symmetrystudios.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Design","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

Progression of myself and others to promote growth whether that be in the individual, or part of the greater picture within an organisation.  I have earned quick promotions in lighting for improving delivery, increasing revenue and trimming costs. With great knowledge working within a NEC3 contract suite, I am able to interpret relevant volumes and able to question when needed, in areas that may assist in a profitable delivery of the contract. As Lighting Operations Manager in one of the countries most challenging networks, TfL, whether it was operational difficulties or constraints of the client and its consumers, I have gained valuable experience in major projects such as the highway deliverance of the Olympic Route network in 2012 along with numerous events such as the Marathon, Ride London or in assisting with lighting in box office motion pictures. I have specifically managed installation of large Lighting projects whether that be in the more traditional sense in a column replacement scheme outside the hustle and bustle of Harrods, lantern replacements throughout London through to architectural lighting of iconic underpasses.","2019","Business Manager","Southwark Council","https://www.linkedin.com/company/24216","http://www.southwark.gov.uk"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Government Administration","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

I have worked across all sectors in the lighting industry with a focus on galleries, workplace, daylight design, leisure, aviation, public realm, and retail.  Since 2006 I have been lucky enough to create and lead an experienced and proactive group of people who each bring a unique element to the field of lighting design and technology.  With lighting designers, interior designers, architects, light artists and product designers, the team has the ability to realise every element of lighting design and co-ordinate with other architecture and engineering disciplines. I still look back at my first lighting design project, the national museum of film, photography and television as the turning point in my understanding of how light can impact on us; our perception of a space and how elements and objects can be brought to our attention or blended to become the background.  A fair amount of time has passed since then (1996/7) and I have learnt a lot, but the appeal of lighting design is that there is always more to learn and so much more we can do for people and the buildings and spaces they use.   I contribute to a number of lighting design guides in the UK and provide lectures and seminars on lighting design topics.

Here are 3 very real things about me: 1)  I'm a pragmatic person and will always find an opportunity to get into the workshop where possible. I'm a big believer that, if you can't make things, then how can you successfully engineer products that ultimately have to be made? I love to troubleshoot problems and I approach challenges in a systematic way, a skill that I've perfected during my time at ELe working on new electronics products. If I'm not Making things work, at work, I'm renovating my house which has involved learning a lot of new skills. Tilling, wiring and woodwork are some of the things I've turned my hand to over the last year. Although my favourite experience was putting my CAD to good use to design and aid the project management of my own bathroom. 2) I was raised on a farm where shearing the sheep heard gained me more Kudos than any qualification that I received throughout my education. The practical skills and 'work hard ethic' instilled by my upbringing have made me the person I am today, always keen to get stuck in!  3) People give me energy, I thrive around others and enjoy working as part of a team or where appropriate, leading. I am a concise communicator and am eager to teach which means I often find myself in positions of responsibility. I love to take ownership of projects and I'm not afraid to put forward my ideas.","2020","Mechanical Design Engineer","G4S","https://www.linkedin.com/company/5355","http://www.g4s.com"," "," "," "," ","Leicester, England, United Kingdom","Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing","ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",

After around 6 months of college I was offered my apprenticeship at Kuroda Jenatec, a spindle and ballscrew manufacturer. During my employment I wired and tested thousands of spindles, between 10 and 20 control panels amongst other responsibilities.  After this period it was time for me to move on, the main reason for this was due to me having no electrical superior or mentor and wanting to learn more and advance my career. I was then successful at gaining a 6 month trainee role for Electrical Design at Gebhardt European Conveyor Systems in which then turned into a full position. During my time there I designed many different types of conveyor systems for different sectors. After a few years at GECS, I had the opportunity to move to LAC Conveyors & Automation and expand my knowledge and work with automation and food & beverage, not only conveyors. During my employment at LAC I have been given a promotion from Electrical Design to Lead Electrical Design gaining extra responsibilities such as resource management, sales support & post-sales technical support. I look forward to progressing my knowledge and career further.

During my career with the Royal Navy I developed into an effective and reliable member of the SWS department (Strategic weapon system) And a experienced watch keeper maintaining essential equipment. My duties would include Planned maintenance when on-shore or highly pressured Reactive maintenance when on operation, due to the nature of the Submarine Service being unpredictable and mentally challenging I gained the ability to use both practical skills and mental logic to quickly diagnose technical faults within the boat I was drafted to. I had to rectify them as efficiently and as far as reasonably practical minimising downtime's and reducing potential life threatening situations. Throughout my career on submarines I have developed skills in many areas of maintenance and have shown I can adapt myself to any given task.  Previously working for CBRE as an Electrical/Mechanical Engineer at BP Exploration (ICBT) Sunbury. I gained a sound knowledge of basic and complex engineering systems. Having gained a good reputation as an on-site engineer which is home to 3,500 staff as current across 13 separate onsite locations, dealing with planned and unplanned maintenance. Ultimately my job role required me to liaise with various departments, which has given me a strong work ethic and excellent communication skills which I strive to improve constantly.  Working for ISS/RBS I was based at Coutts bank. Covering 5 separate banks in central London as an Electrical/Mechanical lead shift engineer. Working alongside projects has given me a broader understanding within engineering management. Overseeing multiple projects with works we had for our prestigious clients. Reactive and Planned maintenance from day to day and planning work in advance for the following week. Moving to Norway (Oslo) working within data centres for a global client, looking after critical systems including renewable energy designed specifically for the sites.

I joined Central in 2013, having previously taught at the Theatre Studies Faculty University of Peloponnese, and I often visit other universities and organisations for lectures and workshops, in the UK and abroad. Through practice, research and teaching, I explore ways of using different spaces and architectures as scenographic tools in theatre and performance.  I often work as a scenographer/-initiator/-leader of performances or installations, sometimes inspired by biographical and every-day-life subjects. Theatres, abandoned buildings, urban outdoors locations and landscapes, homes and flats, a bar and my olive grove, are all spaces that I have explored and used in past projects. Current projects include a ‚Äòwalking performance‚Äô and a site-responsive performance/installation, using a bridge and a Victorian warehouse in London as scenographic metaphors. I also collaborate with directors as a designer in theatre productions, investigating how to use a theatre building as a ‚Äòfound space‚Äô. I designed the new studio theatre of Athens National Theatre, a flexible-retractable-transformable space that won a ‚ÄòGold Medal for Best Work in Theatre Architecture and Performance Space‚Äô at the Prague Quadrennial 2011.

I have a true passion for electronics and mechanical engineering and throughout my personal and working life I have been lucky enough to really get into depth with a lot of different fields of engineering. I can very quickly pick up new skills and knowledge through self-learning and practice and I relish using technology in innovative ways to find solutions to a variety of problems. I‚Äôm always eager to get stuck in to a task or project thanks to my constantly active mind and overtly technical nature. I have spent 7 years working in an industrial environment with a focus on smart security and safety systems which has helped install an impeccable attention to detail and strong work ethic in me. I always strive for perfection in whatever I do and I honestly feel that if a job or task is not done to the best of my abilities then I have failed at it. Most recently I‚Äôve spent 3 years working for the University of Nottingham as an electro mechanical design and prototype engineer where I have had to quickly teach myself a lot of advanced skills on the fly helped along by the fantastic team of old school engineers and technicians, I have quickly become the go to person for the entire research group for specialist engineering 3D Printing advice thanks to my subject matter expertise. I enjoy spending my spare time in a self-motivated state learning about new things that have not yet crossed my path and then putting them to practical use whilst tinkering in my workshop, I consider myself to be a self-taught multi skilled engineer from start to finish.

Period as RIBA President structured around 'Designing the Future Profession'. I provide strategic leadership, liaising closely with RIBA Council, Board and staff to press forward on an agenda that modernises the institute, advances chartered architects & practices in addressing the major challenges facing the world, society & the industry.   I develop my role through listening, chairing & contributing, my monthly contributions to the RIBAJ, meeting & collaborating with government departments & agencies, judging & being visible through various media. Experience of practice & education helps me appreciate the pressures & opportunities of both.  My first 10 years of practice were in London, seven with Michael Hopkins & Partners, as they received the RIBA Gold Medal, & with David Morley Architects.  I returned to N Ireland to practice & teach, exploring how to enhance a culture for architecture.  Built projects I have worked on have received 7 RIBA awards, 2 Stirling Prize shortlisted, & been published widely in the professional & mainstream press. I act as an expert witness & judge on design matters. I led the education of future architects in Queen‚Äôs University from 2008 to 2016, from mid rankings to regularly being placed high in the league tables & first in 2018 for added value.

A career spanning Apprentice, shop floor through to various board appointments, including Government, gives a unique DNA to be exploited for commercial profit and sustainability. Working in the health and fitness industry for the last 6 years Mark has realised over 500 products and Sku's into 5 figures. Utilising his experience as a founder, MD and Chairman of an engineering company for 25 years, he was able to introduce a GB engineering and fabrication division from property sourcing, equipment and personnel appointment to handing over fully operational with all production and QA processes and procedures, turning a profit within 6 months. With expansion into the USA, Mark orchestrated the set up of a USA warehouse after a previous attempt had failed. Mark now design manages and procures product development from concept to commercial handover including but not limited to Ideation, Market Assessment, Design and Specification, Cost vs MRSP analysis, Rapid Proto's, Supplier Manufacturing, Factory Audits Internationally, First off tool production product evaluation and test, Packaging, User Guides, QA, Final Data Dossier (DNA).The gated process has proven effective and enabled products to be released into the market expediently, with a significantly reduced defective and complaint rate, from circa 5% of T/O to 0.2%. With unique commercial fitness products,  accelerated longevity testing is critical, due to no availability, Mark designed his own test lab and project managed manufacture, he also secured Government funding to finance. Mark is an ECO Warrior and reducing Environmental Impact is a key requisite in any of his product developments and without any compromise to profitability.  A totally different approach and project management style has enabled accelerated growth,  together with improved quality  reliability and profitability  enabled from Mark's wide knowledge and achievements via contract design and manufacturing for industrial sectors such as Nuclear, Power, Engine Manufacturers, Automotive, Architectural, Interiors, Medical, University Research, Pharmaceutical, Leisure, Construction (Buildings) and with all types of materials from Stainless Steel, Glass through to Special Alloys, Textiles and Plastics.

I joined the Architects Registration Board (UK) in 2007 and became a chartered member of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2014. I qualified as an architect and urban planner at The Polytechnic University of Milan in 2003. The knowledge and skills built up during this time, along with being adaptable, self-motivated, driven to strive for continual improvement, and having a rigorous approach make me an inspired and pragmatic architect. I am currently an associate director at Astudio, an architectural practice founded in 2007 by Richard Hyams. The practice has offices in London and Lisbon in Portugal and I am developing a business strategy to consolidate the dual office structure in the two countries and to expand the Lisbon office. I am also the project architect of the Chicago Booth MBA campus of the University of Chicago in London.  I joined Astudio last year after having directed, for almost ten years, WAY Architecture Yell: an architectural practice that is now lead solely by Priscilla Pinotti. I founded WAY in 2010 with my wife Priscilla Pinotti, a Brazilian architect who was my colleague during the years I worked at the London based architectural design firm Foster + Partners. WAY is a boutique design oriented architectural practice based in central London, with a sister company based in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. This dual office structure allows to reach clients based in the UK where the design is developed, with most of the architectural drawings and 3D models produced in the Brazilian branch. I developed this model of work in 2013 migrating the information production into the BIM Platform and setting up the procedures for long distance team coordination of the BIM 3D model. This has had a very positive impact on the company as it allows the UK branch to be more competitive and at the same time provides a unique opportunity to bring local Brazilian architects to work on high quality sustainable architectural projects. Some of the design work I have overseen produced by WAY has become a point of reference for the Brazilian community and widely published in international and local magazines. In August 2018 Thames and Hudson published Casa Moderna: Latin American Living, by Philip Jodidio, in which Moinho Villa, delivered by WAY in 2015, was featured among ‚Äòthe most accomplished contemporary houses‚Äô that have marked Latin American residential architecture.","2019","Associate Director","astudio architects","https://www.linkedin.com/company/886102","http://www.astudio.co.uk","costa.carlo@gmail.com"," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Architecture & Planning","ü¶Ü-default-invited|Sent Blog 1|Sent Blog 2|Sent blog 3"," ","",

Twitter: @nudgegroup Instagram: @nudge_group Head honcho and driver of Nudge ‚Äì Shankari Raj, known as Shanks wants to challenge traditional approaches to architecture head-on, focusing on community led, sustainable design processes.  She was born in Srilanka, grew up in Nigeria, Oman, Toronto and London before settling in Bristol and setting up her own practice.  She takes the approach of hiring people on a job by job basis as she believes each project needs to be embedded in place. Her office is filled with creatives working in a range of sectors from digital campaigns to building walk about robots. She is a visiting lecturer and external examiner at Architecture schools across the country: Cardiff, Newcastle, Sheffield, and Bath University. She has been an ongoing judge for the Architectural Journal and WAN awards. Her work has frequently been used as case studies for future application across the country. She is regularly invited to speak at lectures and panels including the Design Council, Architecture Centre and Glass House. Alongside other design and strategy projects, she brought together Common Capital, Cardiff University and Pop Up Bristol to collaborate on a research project for The London Legacy Development Corporation, investigating how to successfully deliver Meanwhile Use Spaces on underused sites.  Her practice Nudge is a versatile architecture practice with a strong reputation for designing and delivering spaces that enable people to innovate, be bold, work, muse and reflect. Nudge is behind a growing portfolio of award-winning spaces in the UK and beyond. Recent projects include, The GreenWay project, OVO Energy headquarters, Engine Shed and Temple Studios. In 2007 she received a distinction for her masters thesis on, 'Making Development Sustainable - A Social Paradigm,' and was listed as one of the UK's standout graduates in Building Design (BD) Magazine. Her thesis also won her an RIBA award and landed her a position as Associate Director of International Organisation 'Local Futures' after learning much from her mentor Helena Norberg Hodge.  Brunel‚Äôs famous Engine Shed lounge is an example of branding and design which has propelled Bristol's position as a city of creative innovation.

I use data, analytics, simulations, and a lot of common sense to make buildings and urban spaces work for people. More recently I am advising clients on implementing #SocialDistancing in buildings and campuses, to help with a phased reopening. I study people. I analyse human behaviour. In airports, museums, theatres, workplaces, stadia, campuses and city centres. With this insight and some powerful predictive modelling tools I optimise operational strategies for existing spaces. And design of new spaces, before they are built. But can you predict human behaviour and emotions? This is precisely what I do for my clients ‚Äì to super-charge how their assets perform - economically, environmentally and experientially. My work is informed by deep cross-sector experience and insights I have developed over 15 years. And supported by the team I lead, which includes some of the best minds in the industry The Analytics team at BuroHappold leads the way in data analytics, predictive modelling and simulations. We develop rapid integrated design and operational modelling tools that assess the impact of layouts, processes, daylight, wind, noise, thermal comfort‚Ä¶ all in near/real-time. We use them within collaborative workshops, while changing the building forms, layouts and scenarios right within the BIM, GIS or WEB environment. Places are for people. In an industry where efficiency and predictability is a big challenge, we are shifting the focus of designs and decisions. It's all about people ‚Äì the visitors, passengers, audience, employees, students and shoppers the spaces are meant for. Ultimately I am all about delivering places that enhance client outcomes such as human experience, productivity, asset performance, economic impacts and resilience. Feel free to contact me and join me in bringing data, evidence and people back to the heart of design and strategic decisions.

Still working with light though. Now as an Architectural & Interiors Photographer I focus on documenting the built environment with a specialisation in capturing lighting design schemes. Long Bio I travel a lot. I have to, but I enjoy it. Spending most of my time between London and Athens, I take on assignments on a freelance basis. Originally trained as an Electrical Engineer, I worked at the Lighting Laboratory of the National Technical University while obtaining my MEng. Intrigued by not just the science but by the playful nature of light, I went on to obtain the Light & Lighting MSc at the Bartlett School of Graduate Studies in UCL (London) before pursuing a career in London as an Architectural Lighting Designer. Over the years I designed the lighting for a variety of projects around the world, ranging from high-end hotels, super yachts and luxurious residential developments to restaurants, art galleries and public realm spaces.  My passion for photography led me to establish GavriiLux, a London based creative consultancy. I am now working worldwide with lighting designers, architects, interior designers and brands offering architectural photography and content creation services. My portfolio includes award winning photos of the Kimpton Fitzroy Hotel in London (IALD Radiance Award 2019), the National Museum of Qatar and the Four Seasons Hotel in Athens , amongst others.","2015","Senior Designer","Lighting Design International","https://www.linkedin.com/company/419406","http://www.lightingdesigninternational.com","gavriilpap@gmail.com"," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Photography","ü¶Ü-default-invited|Sent Blog 1|Sent Blog 2|Sent blog 3"," ","",

He has 40 years‚Äô experience in music television, AV, and lighting for initially the leisure business, now broader band encompassing commercial, schools and office lighting. He has managed and directed many installations in theme parks, leisure facilities, museums, offices and commercial premises around the world, many of which have been award winning. Having envisioned, at an early stage, the potential for LED lighting, Simon established Met 3 (an LED assembly and manufacturing company based in South Wales). He has also been instrumental - working with companies in China, Taiwan, and EU - in developing commercial white light LED fixtures improving upon existing thermal management and flicker-free driver technology resulting in greater efficacy and consequent efficiency and safety of the latest LED lighting. This has helped secure Lighting Engine a unique market position in terms of both supply and quality control, managing all aspects of LED Lighting from manufacture to installation and smart energy-saving programmes. Simon is a first rate operational executive possessing an informal management style.

I work alongside the marketing team, to create and present RIBA Accredited CPD presentations. With a technical background spanning various sectors, I am well placed to deliver our CPDs to further educate our colleagues across the construction industry on lighting practices.  We currently offer 2 CPD Presentations:  Workplace Lighting Design: An Introduction - this course is great to show those who may be unfamiliar the lighting design process. We start off with a quick 'Jargon Buster' just to ensure no-one is left behind on key lighting terms, before reviewing and deconstructing some of the UK lighting guidelines. We then finish with a worked example for designing CAT A and CAT B schemes.  Audience Feedback - 'Thank you for a good brilliant session, you covered everything well, I think you definitely struck a good balance between simplicity for a beginner and detailed and interesting enough for the more experienced' Wireless Lighting Controls: An Introduction - This presentation briefly reviews the history of lighting controls before looking at 3 examples of different solutions on the market and how they would be used in varying projects. We look at the examples individually, before comparing at the end. We consider the advantages and disadvantages of using wireless controls and look at how we think the technology might evolve.  I graduated with a First Class, BSc (Hons) Lighting Design and Technology at the University of Southwales in 2017. Since then, I have worked in High End Residential and Marine lighting globally, and now in the commercial lighting sector.","2018","Project Engineer","299 Lighting Ltd.","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2217063","https://www.299lighting.co.uk/","joshbell95@googlemail.com"," "," "," ","South Gloucestershire, England, United Kingdom","Design","|ü¶Ü-default-invited|Sent Blog 1|Sent Blog 2|Sent blog 3"," ","",

So if you want something to happen, and you need to communicate important messages please get in touch. McCann offers a high quality, multiple award-winning and excellent value for money worldwide service. UTILITIES - ENERGY As a father of three, I am naturally concerned that the environment is ever-deteriorating and it is already killing hundreds of thousands of people every year.  Individually we can only make a small impact and many of us are doing what we can by being more energy-efficient. However, many organisations can still make massive improvements in their energy use and this can both reduce their carbon footprint but also save them large sums of money. So I have teamed up with specialist efficiency experts who advise, specify, design, supply, systems that reduce the amounts of energy used and generate green energy on-site. We can even arrange self-funding interest-free finance deals that mean the investments are paid for out of the savings generated, still leaving you with lower costs.  Then we offer an award-winning broking service that ensures the energy that has to be bought is supplied at the lowest possible price. Our service wins awards and is available across the UK. So, let's talk. It's FREE.","2018","Ambassador","Global Goodwill Ambassadors (GGA)","https://www.linkedin.com/company/13603636","http://www.globalgoodwillambassadors.org","ian@ianmccann.com","+44 (0) 7778 641566"," "," ","Middlesbrough, England, United Kingdom","Media Production","|ü¶Ü-default-invited|Sent Blog 2|donotmessage|Sent blog 3"," ","",

I build up parts lists, including Bought Out items and send Purchase Orders to suppliers.  Prior to these latest projects I workied on automated fork trucks for a Leicester company, seeing design and detailing on existing and concept pallet moving trucks. I have worked on projects for heavy duty yellow goods, such as telehandlers and back hoes for another Leicestershire company. I was involved in pipe taping machines for a Leicester based company too. I have a varied and interesting design skill set from heavy engineering with +/- 3mm tolerances right down to high precision machinery working to +/-0.01mm tolerances.  I am highly skilled in Solidworks and have experience working on Pro Engineer to a high level with some experience in Inventor. I can use AutoCAD to a basic level.

What challenges involved in engineering something that complicated. This led me at the age of 26 to leave my career as an HGV Technician behind and study an engineering degree full-time. I soon discovered that my prior knowledge as a vehicle technician would pay dividends in my studies as an Engineer. Being able to visualise in a practical application the theory being presented to me at university, solidified my knowledge and gives me an alternative insight compared to my class members. During my time at university I also captained a team in the MATE ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) competition, I led a team of five engineers to design and develop an ROV from scratch and entered it into an international competition. At the competition finals in Michigan we had to overcome some major issues to return with three awards one including design elegance and the highest position the University had achieved in this competition. Post my university studies I took a graduate scheme with Siemens rail systems. This put me on rotation in various different departments that has given me valuable experience in different business functions outside of engineering. I feel has given my career a good grounding and broadened my understanding. For the last three years I have applied my passion for motorcycles as a design engineer for Triumph motorcycles. This has allowed me to use my natural creativity and alternative thinking, combined with my previous knowledge drawn from my HGV Technician career to design a ground up new motorcycle. I have gone from taking a vehicle apart and wondering how and why it is made the way it is, to being the person engineering, designing and knowing why and how it is made that way. I am very proud of how far I have come and want to keep growing my career in the future and completely enjoy getting very excited about the engineering and the detail. I'm always looking to grow my personal and professional network. Feel free to connect via LinkedIn or contact me directly at headmatthew316@gmail.com.

Here is a brief summary of some of the recent work I have done.  At Scuderia Alpha Tauri I worked on the AT01 2020 F1 challenger. I was working on suspension and brake components. Design of structural and non structural composite parts; incorporating the aero wet surfaces into the component design. Generating kinematic model to produce new interface points to adjust steering geometry. At McLaren Racing I worked on the MCL32 battery design and installation. Including; component packaging and mounting; manufacturing and test jig design; design of bespoke plug assemblies; and electrical and coolant conduit routing. While at JCB Telehandlers I have been responsible for producing mechanical design solutions from concept to production. During which time I have managed prototype production and testing; supplier management, and pre-production build introduction. I have personally introduced two bespoke kinematic mechanical mounting solutions; for the auxiliary oil cooler and the bonnet strut.  As part of the design introduction process I have prepared product change support documentation, including engineering change requests; as well as engineering instructions for prototype build changes. During my time at RML in 2015 I worked on many areas of the design for a prestigious record breaking OEM electric hyper car; including suspension components, interior and exterior composite structure; EV powertrain packaging and mounting; battery packaging and mounting. In 2013 I designed the fabricated structures to perform homologation crash testing for the Nissan Zeod RC, including submitting hand calculations and analysing the structures using FEA (NX NASTRAN). I also worked extensively on the analysis and design of the rear suspension components. I worked on carbon composite exterior body panels for both the Zeod RC and the RML Chevrolet Cruze WTC1 cars. This also entailed mechanical mounting of various ancillary components, coolant pipe routing for the IC engine and the battery electrolyte.","2020","Design Engineer","ALTEN LTD - UK","https://www.linkedin.com/company/18669708","http://www.alten.co.uk","gary.poole@outlook.com"," "," "," ","Leicester, England, United Kingdom","Aviation & Aerospace","ü¶Ü-default-invited|Sent blog 3"," ","",

Every problem has a solution and with the right talent pool and an open minded approach anything is possible. I'm yet to find a problem that wasn't solvable and my success over some 30 years is evidence of that.  During my career at Samsung, BenQ and Mitsubishi Electric I have been extremely successful by developing an in depth understanding of the relevant markets.  I've had extensive experience as a company spokesperson in all roles including overseas publications and here in Australia. Locally appearing across all media platforms including TV, Radio, news print, magazines, online articles and both podcasts and vodcasts   I'm a strong believer that the consumer must be at the heart of every decision, and its not just about being responsive to competitors, its got to be about staying one step ahead of the consumer. By determining key insights around consumers and shoppers it becomes possible to develop powerful, targeted messaging and executable activities that can be served at the right time and the right place to influence potential customers along the entire path to purchase.  Its then critical to develop strong and  meaningful relationships with the broader industry and all consumer touch points to develop win-win strategic opportunities.  All of this is possible if you find the right passionate people who can execute with a sense of urgency.","2019","Head of Australia","Bowers & Wilkins","https://www.linkedin.com/company/899421","https://www.bowerswilkins.com"," "," "," "," ","Greater Sydney Area","Consumer Electronics",""," ","",

I have in the process acquired a robust understanding of the specific challenges presented by an evolving high hazard environment. I also have exceptionally strong project management skills having worked over the years on some of the most significant multi-million construction, commissioning and decommissioning projects in the nuclear sector including Capenhurst (for URENCO UUK - uranium enrichment facility), the decommissioning of Trawsfynydd Nuclear Power Station (for Magnox) and Hinkley Point B (EDF). This general aptitude set is supported by my strong technical management skills. I am always working hard to find new and innovative ways of enhancing safety and delivery standards for the business that I work with. I can act as a point of contact for liaison with Regulatory inspectors and I have deputised for the SHEQ Manager when required. As safety and health at work is a matter of efficient management, I also pride myself on being able to work quickly and effectively in appraising all of the potential issues and challenges  that might affect any aspect of the project platform as they arise, getting to understand them as best I can and working to find a solution without causing undue delay and in alignment with the business needs. Since health and safety is a management responsibility of equal importance to production and quality. Therefore as a safety professional, I make every effort to work well with and also lead teams of multi-discipline people of varying sizes, as I enjoy the process of team working very much, getting people to work as effectively as possible towards the desired objective is especially satisfactory; and I also like motivating and encouraging people too. I am a very good communicator and I have strong social and interpersonal skills and it gives me great satisfaction to see everything come together at the end of the day.

Looking back on 30 years in lighting, not only have I been privileged to be involved designing and supplying some great lighting solutions but most importantly I am delighted to continue to work with people and companies I knew from the outset. Thank you to them. This insight really describes a level of invested personal trust which I care about deeply and which guides my strategy for Phi Lighting. I can, therefore, only view it as critical to my/our success in future.  This crucial responsibility manifests itself as a quest for Client retention and satisfaction, such that we regard our Customer Journey is paramount. Outside of work I love all things sport, especially rugby which I played a while back; remember if I ever meet you: 'the older I get, the better I was!'  I also still turn my arm over at Stratford-upon-Avon Golf Club where I can often be seen handing small sums over to better players. The professional bit..... Phi Lighting is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and sale of high quality, design-led lighting products and systems which add value and benefit through technical innovation. We specialise in the London commercial office and workplace and education markets. I think the business environment we work in changes rapidly to reflect the evolution in user, cultural and technological landscapes. As a business we too must adapt to embrace these changes, nevertheless, my personal conviction is that we, as people, must gather to create together.

At Kemps Architectural Lighting, I am fortunate to work with a great bunch that brings out the best out in me, and each other. When I joined over three years ago, we put a plan in place to grow the company with new products and innovations so others could benefit from the team's good work.  Those plans are now coming to fruition as the business rapidly widens its product offering with a shift towards LED lighting as well as remaining a market leader for Cold Cathode and Neon lighting. We are proud that our cold cathode products are manufactured in the UK and we do all types of linear lighting.

My interests span across many fields including graphics, design, photography and engineering. I love seeing an idea turning into a concrete, tangible object. Through my education I have learned to consider the technical aspects of an object, yet the experience of working as product designer at Plumen has taught me to appreciate the aesthetical properties. Indeed, people care about objects that are pleasing to their senses and, as such, designing a gorgeous yet practical item for a client is very rewarding.  Without a doubt, my biggest achievement is the creation of Electric Bamboo Bicycle, project that I have initially started as a research study and that have decided to realise in practice. The design of the bike‚Äì from sketches to CAD models ‚Äì was done solely by me. To actually build it, I contacted international manufacturers and suppliers, adjusted the prototype and overcame various practical issues, including financial problems.   At a glance, here is what I can provide:  - I have thorough knowledge in Solidworks CAD as well as CATIA software. - I have experience in dealing with cost, time and material related constraints that any project is   likely to implicate; - I always give great attention to the details, the quality that is evident in all my projects; - Ability to develop the idea of craftsmanship: I can work with various materials such as wood, metal, plastic and composites; - I have improved my creative skills through photography as well engineering skills through projects like a new kind of car suspension design; - Used rapid prototyping: 3D printing, CNC Routing and Laser Cutting. Being involved in all stages of the product development is essential for me.","2016","Product Designer","Precision Lighting Ltd","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1470043","http://www.precisionlighting.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Design","|ü¶Ü-default-invited"," ","",
