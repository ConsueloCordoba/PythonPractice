I founded Massive Bio after a family situation in cancer because I am obsessed with enabling access to clinical trials to cancer patients around the globe regardless of their location and/or financial stability. I am also obsessed with 'making things work' regardless of how difficult it is or even if I am the only person in the universe that believes in it. Lastly, I am obsessed with delighting our pharmaceutical and CRO customers as I understand the value of gaining and retaining customers.  Prior to Massive Bio, I was at the founding team of EY's Private Equity Value Creation where I helped private equity companies in investment decisions in healthcare and how to maximize their return from their portfolio companies in their investment life-cycle. I have been a part of hundreds of deals. I spent 10 years in management consulting firms.  In my career, I have always combined strategy, operations and transactions but laser-focused on a specific industry. Revenue generation, profitability and capital efficiency are my objective functions in building businesses. I enable hyper growth but a smart one, not a dumb one where 95% of the digital health companies target.    Though I am hugely in love to Massive Bio and be with it until I die, I don't see myself slowing down and I will continue to found new companies. I just don't want to build a company and I want to build an industry.   Outside healthcare, I am interested in energy and transportation industries. I am deeply inquisitive about the intersection of mathematics and technology.   Prior to business, I finished half a dozen engineering degrees (2 BS+2 MS+PhD), mostly from University of Michigan, and I have even done a quick stint at majoring Math.  Nothing in life has presented to me and thus I always have to work very hard and show extreme perseverance to achieve my dreams.  I am an amateur spinner and a dancer, I don't climb mountains, I don't surf and I don't even have a dog, not even one!","Co-Founder and CEO at Massive Bio","2015","Massive Bio","https://www.linkedin.com/company/9360477/","http://massivebio.com"," ","skurnaz1978@gmail.com"," ","skurnaz1978@gmail.com","MassiveBio","New York, New York, United States","Hospital & Health Care","Sent expert financial data article|Sent finance webinar invite","",

I created Fulcrum Venture Accelerator to help fix this problem. After raising multiple rounds of financing at Kindara, I realized that instead of the disorganized approach that most founders take, I could take a systematic approach to raising capital.  I created a 5 step process for raising seed capital - Tilling, Planting, Watering, Harvesting, Closing. By defining the steps and following my own recipe, I not only knew exactly what to do at every step of my raise, I was also able to raise bigger and bigger rounds as Kindara grew.  After Prima-Temp acquired Kindara, I started helping friends raise seed rounds using the fundraising process I developed. I was excited to see that the process could be taught and applied successfully by entrepreneurs in different industries.  Running out of money is the #1 reason startups fail. I’ve seen many good companies fail because the founder wasn’t able to raise seed funding. Many founders go about the fundraising process in a disorganized and scattered way, or worse they don’t follow a process at all, and they end up wasting a huge amount of time and come up empty handed.  Of course this isn’t their fault, because nobody has been teaching founders a proven process to raise seed funding, and walking them through the steps until now.  In 2020 I founded Fulcrum, a fundraising accelerator for mission-driven entrepreneurs. Every quarter we look for the best companies with a positive social mission, and put them through a rigorous process of fundraising development to help them execute on their raise. We spend time making sure founders understand the process at a deep level, and execute a successful fundraise so they can close their round and get on with building their company.   I like to remind founders that they can delegate marketing, product, finance, customer support, operations, manufacturing, and design, but they can’t delegate fundraising. For this reason becoming excellent at fundraising can massively turbo-charge what a given founder is able to accomplish and the difference they are able to make.  We help our founders be among the top 1% of entrepreneurs when it comes to raising money. To date more than $20M in pre-seed and seed capital has been raised using our process. We look for high-caliber founders who are building something impactful and who are currently raising (or about to be raising) seed capital.

You’re working in your day job, but find yourself constantly thinking about your passion. You want to make a change, and go all-in, but you can’t because you’re in need of a paycheck, or health insurance. DOES THIS STORY SOUND FAMILIAR? Don’t worry, because that was me, too — I was in your shoes. And lived it for MANY years. Then, in March 2020, just as the Coronavirus outbreak was occurring, my corporate job threw me a curveball, & vanished. It was an epiphany moment, & for the first time in 30 years, I was able to put all of my focus and attention into my business; helping my clients.  So how might this impact you?  You may be an expert in your industry, but nobody knows it… OR You may be a one-person show, & don’t have the capacity to produce content… OR Your company gets ignored because the competition outspends you. THIS USED TO BE THE CASE FOR MY CLIENTS WHO WERE: A.) People who don’t know how to find their voice or share their story effectively through writing and/ or video. B.) People who realize that writing and video is critical to their growth, but avoid the camera, or avoid expressing their views on paper. C.) People who realize writing and video is critical to their business, but lack the time or skills to execute. Where do you fall? How can you have a voice and share your story if you’re not visible, and how will people get to know you if you’re silent? They can't, it’s impossible. BUT, I can help you amplify your voice, plus shape and deliver your story through the art of writing and the craft of world class video. I realize that doing this the proper way takes time and energy, and that’s where our team of experts come in to serve you, with a common goal to generate countless leads for your business. WHO I SERVE: Entrepreneurs, Business Executives, Authors, Public Speakers, & Businesses looking for visibility, but are frustrated with paying high fees with little to no results. WHERE I WILL HELP: * Strategy and optimization of your authority & brand. * Content creation including video, & copywriting. * Editing, optimizing, & maximizing content for distribution.  * Simplifying the process so it becomes fun! RESULTS YOU CAN EXPECT: * Increase of your authority & visibility within your industry. * Tremendous increase in lead generation.  * Significant growth of your network utilizing all available platforms. * Uptick in opportunities/ engagement from relevant and respected parties.

I have an ongoing commitment to making certain that only the safest and most effective drugs, devices and biologics find their way to the patient, because the patient is waiting. That’s the motivation that drives my passion for what I do each and every day. My work as an Auditing Systems Strategist, and that of everyone at ClinAudits, helps companies compile and submit data to regulatory bodies for approval in an accurate and efficient way. As a Certified Women-Owned Business Enterprise, I’m proud of the work we have done at ClinAudits since I founded it in 1994. We have served clients across the entire spectrum of the regulated Pharmaceutical industry: biotechnology, biologic, gene therapy, tissue engineering, medical device industries, OTC and RX. Operating strictly within the regulations/guidelines set forth by the FDA and other worldwide regulatory authorities, our efforts are focused on satisfying end-to-end FDA and other governmental regulatory authority GxP compliance requirements around the world. During my career I’ve had the good fortune to work with, and for, countless outstanding professionals in our industry. Early on, I recognized that collaboration and partnership were vital in advancing the life sciences. This awareness spurred my involvement as a speaker and panelist at industry conferences, participating in panel and round-table discussions on topics that are important to fellow auditors and industry colleagues. Beyond my passion for improving the lives of people, lies a passion for other living things. Living plants to be more precise. As a Certified Master Gardener, I love bringing the same detail and care to learning about and growing plants as I do to auditing. As I see it, it’s all about life. Protecting it. Improving it.

My main interest is to invent/develop novel chemical technologies and apply them to the biological field and drug innovation. This interest spurred me to start CellMosaic in 2008 after working for four and a half years in the biotech industry. Although my previous work resulted in a few patents, none of those inventions can be turned into a real value-added product for society. CellMosaic gives me a platform where I can invent and apply my technology to create value for society.  Through CellMosaic’s platform, I have developed the core advanced conjugation process for custom bioconjugation services and commercialized a personalized conjugation kit (PerKit™) and many other bioconjugation-related products based on these processes. One example is the antibody-drug conjugation (ADC) kits that allow customers to perform conjugation in their own labs. Since their launch in 2018, ADC kits have been used successfully by many laboratories. Seeing the direct outcome of my work gives me real joy and motivation to invent more and build/commercialize more products for my customers.  I am also the sole inventor of sugar alcohol-based AqueaTether (AqT™) linkers and other crosslinking and MS-Tag technologies, such as OxLink™, SxLink™, and NeIon™. Currently, I am working with my team to turn all of these technologies into real products.

I work as both 'business therapist' and 'kingmaker' for ideas, humans, and organizations. I came honestly by this trade of ideation, intellectual property extraction, and thought leadership development: I was born to a developmental pediatrician and a poetry therapist, both of them bicameral-thinking healers of minds, bodies, and spirits. I also have a PhD in creativity (actually, classical composition), studying, practicing, and teaching ancient and modern techniques of ideation, publication, and dissemination.  First it was a book and a speech. Clients who brought a script or an idea to me asked for wordsmithing and design. Sensing a sea change coming in the world of publishing, In 2005, I founded independent book publisher, Blooming Twig, releasing hundreds of books, winning awards, and standing for 'books that matter'.  I relished ten years of chalk dust and ideas, teaching writing, leadership, service learning, language, and music to bright-eyed Millennials as a professor at three New York universities. I wrote an award-winning book of my own, and was the ghostwriter of 50 titles. Then, I stood center stage on a red, carpeted dot, giving a TED Talk about the importance of risk-taking and the creative life.  The words I featured as the title of that talk, 'We Are Alive,' mouthed by my father's parched and broken lips around the tubes down his throat, changed my life forever. And now those three words have become anthemic on social media, leading to more than 100 million views, hundreds of thousands of followers, and a humbling task ahead:  How will I become an amplifier for amplifiers? How can I do good by doing well, and do well by doing good? Much to my joy, I have become a town crier, a social media savant, and a serial entrepreneur. I am committed to working with individuals and businesses who have the courage to step out and be unabashedly unique.","Bringing wisdom back. 🐕 Visibility strategist; platforming thought leaders.

I choose to do everything I can to ensure the company, my team, and myself are healthy, engaged and successful. I solve puzzles every day by:  - eliminating the 'noise' and finding a way to get it done!  - collaborating with executives to ensure deliverables for the C-suite are clear and relevant.  - managing travel and expenses.  - setting up meetings that will create results.  - consistently coming up with ways to ease the CEO's workload.  - asking always:  'What can I do for YOU?' Most recently, I completed the relocation of our 5-person team from our Edison campus to our new HQ in Short Hills.  It was my baby for over a year.  Working with our Director of Business Affairs, we scouted sites, collaborated on the office layout, picked out furniture, flooring, paint and finishes.  I enjoyed making labels for moving boxes, making a list of what needed to be moved and the order it needed to go on the truck while reassuring the team that they just had to pack up their stuff and meet me there.  We spent money where it counted and bargain shopped for others. My Dollar Tree DIY crafting came in handy for getting the office quickly stocked and decorated. I even got kudos from a recent new hire on the labeling of the cabinets in the kitchen area.   Never underestimate the impact of seemingly small details. My experience in finance, law, facilities, event planning, medical, recruitment, compliance, real estate, procurement, IT, and manufacturing helps me to collaborate at many levels with an open mind.","I get it done! | Executive Partner | Solution Oriented | Calendar Whisperer | Collaborator | C-Suite Executive Assistant","2018","Integreon Global","https://www.linkedin.com/company/155843/","http://www.Integreonglobal.com/"," ","nprav@hotmail.com"," ","nprav@hotmail.com"," ","Linden, New Jersey, United States","Packaging & Containers","|Sent expert financial data article|Sent finance webinar invite|Sent promote or fire article|Sent sales process blog|🦆-default-followup-1|🦆-default-followup-2|🦆-default-invited","",

My vibrant and energetic friend suffered from mouth sores that made eating painful, resulting in rapid weight loss and, ultimately, succumbing to his cancer.  His family and friends searched, but did not find, safe and clinically appropriate symptom management support.  I thought that if this could happen to Eric and his family, it must be happening to many people. I left my career on Wall Street and spent two years researching the scientific literature regarding the symptom and side effects experienced by cancer patients and interviewing cancer patients, caregivers, and the medical professionals who treat them so that I could create a solution to address these unmet needs in a scientific and clinically appropriate manner.  I found that nutritional strategies are effective in managing the symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment and represent an effective lever to improve outcomes and lower cost of care.  The result of this research is Ina ®, a virtual 'Intelligent Nutrition Assistant' chatbot who provides personalized nutritional strategies for symptom management 24/7 'on demand' via SMS text on a smartphone.

Then staying this side of the 'pond, ' into the world of media, local radio,  and then TV as producer/presenter.  Then returning to global marketing as SVP Marketing & Operations at the Fortune 500 George P.Johnson Group, where they sponsored my board position of the World Trade Centers Association in NYC.

In 2012 I founded the first cloud brokerage on the east coast,  Global Property Systems (GPS). Determined to disrupt the norms of traditional real estate by embracing technology, developing marketing and support teams to provide systems to our local & global “boots on the ground” Realtors, and superior services to all of our clients.  GPS is thriving by doing real estate differently. We are now operating on 3 continents. Our corporate relocation division works directly with executives by removing 3rd party costs and middlemen.

I had to learn how to strategically succeed at navigating on an uneven playing field at work and excel in spite of. Having this knowledge led me to reach the level of a global executive at two iconic companies, Johnson and Johnson and GE. So, I know what it really takes and it wasn't easy, but I was determined as a Black woman navigating to become a leader.  Based on my success, I committed myself to develop and help individuals in achieving what they never thought was professionally possible, especially women and women of color at work. What these experiences prepared and positioned me for was to become an expert in women’s leadership and the advancement of women and women of color in the workplace.  It also prepared me to become the Founder and CEO of FrancineParham & Co., a boutique professional development company for career women and women of color and the holding company for the curated, “Sharpen Your Skills Professional,” leadership and development programs. Also to serve as a Senior Fellow at The Conference Board, a global think tank where my ideas and thoughts are important to move the agenda ahead for women and women of color in leadership. Most recently to create my media channel called, “Advancing Women in the Workplace with FrancineParham and Co.” that I host to ensure the right conversations and insights of other leaders and experts are heard who are also committed to this work like me.    So, I hope you can take away from all of my work and experiences of over two decades that I'm super focused on what women and women of color want and need to advance successfully in their careers. I’ve lived and practiced what I talk about and know to be the realities and the truths at work. And I’m continuing to share what I learned and know to help other women and especially women of color professionally advance as I did. I know that nothing is achieved alone. I understand that it means being intentionally focused and understanding the unwritten rules and unspoken skills needed for career advancement. Hence my work is designed and delivered to position women and women of color to be professionally successful by mastering what they need to advance. Please contact me if your company is interested in my work.","Founder and CEO | Author I Practitioner, Women’s Leadership and Career Advancement I Sr. Fellow, Human Capital Center, The Conference Board I Creator and Host: 'Advancing Women in the Workplace with FrancineParham & Co'","2016","FrancineParham & Co.","https://www.linkedin.com/company/5297991/","https://www.brighttalk.com/channel/18559/"," ","email@francineparham.com","+1 (732)419-3186","email@francineparham.com","francineparham","New York, New York, United States","Professional Training & Coaching","Sent expert financial data article|Sent finance webinar invite|Sent promote or fire article|Sent sales process blog","",

She quickly discovered that cellular agriculture research was not held back by a lack of interest or expertise, but instead by a lack of designated funding channels directed at this intersectional work. Thus began her quest to establish the field of animal products made without animals, one recognized by researchers, funding agencies, and investors. A stint in Policy and Public Affairs at GlaxoSmithKline illuminated the cooperative relationship between non-profits, academia, and companies in translating beneficial science out of the lab and into society. Isha has used a model established in the advancement of medical research to accelerate cellular agriculture, by funding early stage, foundational research in academia in order for ready-to-market technologies to be developed for commercial use.

Since then, I have channeled my love of science into a career in biotech and pharma, working to help commercialize new pharmaceutical products from preclinical development along the product life cycle. My experience varies from global pharmaceutical marketing and sales to data analytics for both small and top-ten pharmaceutical companies, where I have been fortunate enough to gain a thorough understanding of the pharmaceutical commercialization process. I have recently decided to return to my 'scientific' roots, and have begin working with pharmaceutical companies in the clinical trial stages.  Currently, I am working as an Account Executive with Bioclinica where I connect pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the Midwest to Bioclinica's portfolio of integrated technology solutions and software for clinical trial management.

Aurora is going to provide compounds in any format for free, synthesis and providing of hits and leads also for free. How do the partners benefit from collaboration with Aurora? Aurora's drug repositioning program contains a database of 18,000 drugs registered in the USA, Europe, Japan and other countries/parts of the world that allows a quick approval process and speedy commercialization for known drugs having the new or different indications. On the other hand, due the extraordinary large compound collection (18.1 mln.) almost unlimited source of structures for drug research and development is available. Aurora's approach has proven successful for virus and neurological disorders projects with NIH agencies in the USA. Why Aurora's looking for additional partners? Aurora's cooperation with NIH agencies based on cutting edge technology for in vitro, in vivo and in some cases clinical study provides the very good quality hits and leads. In the light of encouraging results we'd like to invite you to participate in drug development projects.  Aurora is looking for additional providers for in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. The partners should be able to fulfill the preclinical studies including in vitro and/or in vivo testing. How to join our partnership? The obtained results will be available to the partners and shared jointly. The intellectual property must be protected by jointly owned patents and drafting of legal documents to avoid pitfalls. The joint venture agreement (or Memorandum of Understanding) should be signed by partners who want to enter into a project together.  Please let me know if you are interested in partnership and/or you have any questions.

I am a graduate from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, a Legal Project Manager and a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt. Throughout my career, as a partner in private practice and in my current role, I have represented governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, as well as publicly-held Fortune 100 companies. I am honored to have been recognized as a Trailblazer by the New York Law Journal in 2019 for being an 'agent of change, thought leader and innovator.'  For the past ten years, I have managed the Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) litigation on behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and various Federal Home Loan banks. Before that, I handled discovery management in the Bernie Madoff bankruptcy litigation. Outside the office, I serve on the Board of Directors of Birch Family Services, Inc. and on its Audit and Compliance Committee. I also sit on the Advisory Boards of Higher Talent and The Merlin OpenSource Foundation. At Karta Legal, I have assembled an entire ecosystem to help organizations in their legal innovation journey. In my team, I have experts in change management, process improvement and mapping, legal technology and the use of AI, cybersecurity and privacy, data management and analytics, e-discovery, project management, and litigation support. We know what works, what doesn't, and how much it should cost.  My goal is innovation and re-designing the delivery of legal services. The path to innovation is simple. First, focus on the people. Second, design or redesign the process. Third, pick the right technology for your specific needs and your budget. To achieve those goals, I use a variety of design thinking and business process improvement tools selected from Lean Six Sigma and Agile Project Management methodologies. Over the years, I have curated and tailored these tools to fit the needs of the legal industry and have applied them successfully. When asked to describe myself I say I am part lawyer, process maven, technologist, educator, Lean Six Sigma facilitator, and innovation driver. Why should we change the way we deliver legal services? The most fundamental reason is because we are bound by professional responsibilities and ethical duties to become technology competent and provide speedy and efficient representation. The most practical reason is because it makes good business sense.

We have started a new, global Connected Insurance initiative to advance Internet of Things /Artificial Intelligence of Things (IoT/AIoT) related to solutions developed with ecosystem partners covering Workers' Safety, Flood, Wildfires and Aquaculture risks.  We are doing this by collaborating with great teams of people and ultimately, the goal is to make more families more resilient by delivering solutions that leverage what I call the 5 P's: Prevention, Pre-emption, Protection, Prediction and Prescriptive (analytics), at the right time with the least amount of friction in the process as possible.   Together, we can and will transform the fundamentals of the insurance business - by developing new models (business and algorithmic-based) that is passively provide digital risk services that prevent, preempt and protect against risks, that are supported by algorithm-based smart analytics that are proactively providing predictive and prescriptive capabilities, where new, dynamic value-based underwriting and pricing models can be introduced and become mainstream. I call this process “leveraging the 5 P’s”, which is essentially moving digital capabilities from business enabler to business driver to ultimately achieve data liquidity. I work closely with a lot of start-ups, including some that have become leaders in the InsurTech space.

A few growth stories I've been fortunate to play a part in: ➡️ Lafayette 148 where eCommerce revenue grew from $8MM annually to $45MM in a 4.5 year period. ➡️ Ecru which experienced 580% online sales growth turning into a multi-million dollar luxury fashion brand. ➡️ Fine Accoutrements, a men's grooming brand which has broken monthly sales records for 14 straight months (and counting), all without any significant digital advertising. ➡️  Multiple clients recently have hit all-time highs/ record months already during the 2020 holiday season.    My 21 years of digital experience comes from a wide range of verticals: Lafayette 148 New York (fashion), 92nd Street Y (not-for-profit), Rita Hazan (beauty), Le Cordon Bleu culinary (food), and much more. A little bit about Needle Movement: We specialize in digital marketing for emerging brands. And especially 😍 conversation marketing. Conversation commerce is the next wave of marketing and we’re in the early innings. Email is crushing it, SMS is just catching on and Messenger is the first of many more platforms that are enabling chat commerce.  Needle Movement works with retail brands to get them on board first. We take care of setting up each platform, matching brand voice and building out the automation flows.  And while most brands are already doing emai marketing, our engagements are designed to unlock money that's being left on the table.  We offer different engagements to match company needs and budgets. Some brands benefit from outside expertise for a few months and others need a full engagement to check all the boxes for them.  Message me on LinkedIn to hear more about how we can help your brand.   We’re especially interested in working with purpose-driven brands that stand for something and want to use their powers for good.  _______________________________________________________________________________________ I have presented at conferences including Luxury Interactive and SearchCon on the topics of conversation marketing, conscious eCommerce and email strategy.  Available for speaking engagements: panel discussions, virtual summits, podcasts, seminars.

An international digital, design and content agency supporting clients in the life science space across the world. Today, I live in Boston - the epicentre of global drug development.  And I'm a proud keynote speaker, podcaster, blogger, guest lecturer and Forbes Agency Council Member. During my career, I’ve had the privilege of working with and advising over 60 brands in the life science supply chain globally on comms, digital marketing and creative strategy. Biotech, pharma, CMOs, CDMOs, CROs, CPOs, tech, equipment, testing firms - the lot.  As the team has expanded, my job has gone from doing the doing, to growing and leading the company, globally. This has been a tad stressful at times but a tremendously enjoyable ride. Our multi-award-winning company has offices in Newcastle and Manchester, UK and Cambridge/Boston, Mass, USA. So, what does ramarketing do? We’re in the business of helping fast-growing companies in the life science (pharmaceutical and biotech) sectors get noticed. We now work with some of the biggest names and fastest growing companies in the drug development supply chain. By helping clients unearth what makes them different, we enable them to raise profile, demonstrate expertise and secure inbound leads through a combination of tactics such as design, web, content, search and social. If our clients grow and succeed, then so do we. It’s pretty simple. One of the things I am most proud of is the team and the culture I have nurtured at ramarketing. I simply love my staff. They are awesome. We pay people well and give them a flexible work-life balance, which translates into a client-focused workforce and high staff retention. We're an agency driven by collective purpose and enjoyment, not money. We have as culture with genuine soul and personality. Today, I am as thirsty as ever for knowledge in a bid perfect my craft, grow the business and help more brands. I'm a keynote speaker at various business events and conferences. I guest lecture marketing and PR students and my insights have been covered by various publications. I also regularly appear on entrepreneurial podcasts across the UK and US to share my experience and knowledge.  So that's me. If you’re interested in me and what we do, get in touch.

Of course you intend to help, but just like a parent solving their children's biggest challenges, you're creating a dependency on you. For your people to solve their problems so they don't keep coming back again and again, they need to shift from firefighting and surface level solutions, instead, to root-level problem solving. Solving problems at the root means that those problems go away forever. Here are some tools that will help you strengthen your roots: Hold a weekly meeting, first for your leadership team, and eventually for every group in your company. The meeting exists for one reason: to SURFACE and SOLVE your company's biggest challenges at the root level.  Discover the single metric - and it will be different for everyone - that captures each person's most important value contribution to your company. Then, have each person track, weekly, the target and actual value of that metric.  Help each of your leaders define their 3 most important quarterly goals. Then, review whether those goals are on course at your weekly leadership meeting.  As coaches, we work closely with your leadership team to systematize your business. This means everyone in your company has the same processes, tools, vocabulary and vision. From this, strong accountability, alignment and execution emerge.  Just like a nutritionist can help you with physical health and a psychologist can help with mental health, we help your company achieve organizational health. This enables you to do less of what you shouldn't be doing, and more of what you love! If you're looking to scale up, I invite you to have a conversation. Whether or not we work together, I'm confident our call will be full of insights and actionable steps that can help you grow your business.

This includes quality service that in the past may have been only available to high-net-worth individuals. As a fee-only advisor and fiduciary, I have an obligation to represent the interests of my clients first and foremost.  MY VISION: My vision in starting my own full-service wealth management firm after working for so many years in large broker-dealers was to provide business owners and the individual investor with best-in-class guidance and disciplined execution. Today, I work with clients from all over the United States to facilitate achievement of their financial goals whether that be wealth accumulation or financial planning. My strength is my skill in portfolio management whether working with modest investors just starting out, more established clients with greater assets or wealthier individuals looking for a better experience. MY STRENGTH: I build portfolios that graduate and grow with each client as they evolve in their life while still providing a high level of service that is essential in good relationships. I enjoy working with clients, earning their trust, developing an understanding of what matters most and helping clients meet the financial challenges that come with every stage of life. For me, it's a privilege and an honor to be trusted by clients large and small. The common denominator is always the same--authenticity and honesty in working with clients and delivery of a quality experience regardless of the size of the assets under management. MY AREAS OF EXPERTISE:  ● Fee-Only/Fiduciary ● Investment Strategies ● Investment Advisory Services ● Wealth Management ● Portfolio Management ● Stock Selection LET'S CONNECT: I would be eager to speak with prospective clients, colleagues and other professionals for networking or to establish mutual purpose. The best way to reach me is via LinkedIn or email at Kurt@ZenithCapital.us. Even better, schedule a time to talk on www.Calendly.com/KurtFetter. I look forward to connecting!

Then when they start making that compound and test the performance, they'll want to revisit the toxicity closer to commercializing. Giving a tool like ViridisChem’s Chemical Analyzer to R&D chemists empowers them to pay attention to toxicity during their daily work.” ____Dr. David Constable, Industry expert and Director of the ACS Green Chemistry Institute, and the author of more than 28 journal publications and books  “All scientists would prefer to avoid using toxic chemicals and minimize the health and ecological impact of the products they are creating.  Companies also see the obvious social and economic benefits in delivering products with minimum toxicity footprint. But easy access to toxicity information about the chemicals is a major problem. ViridisChem is addressing this critical problem and offers tremendous benefit to all the companies during early stages of product development.  ____Dr. Niteen A.

In 2006, I started the Quality Risk Management (QRM) project at Roche, which was implemented in 2009.

Williams To understand me is to understand my experience. I once weighed 327 pounds and somehow used my moxie, grit and determination to talk my way into funding for a company that didn’t even exist — Curvy Girlz Lingerie. I made this company a reality and my ability to think on my feet, boldly break the rules and tell a story has since made me the #KillerPitchMaster. Some also refer to me as the female McGuyver of business!  Not only am I a 13-time elevator pitch champion, I’ve successfully appeared on “Shark Tank” and taken my company from $0 to multi-6 figures in less than 2 years. I’ve since watched my clients gain national and international media attention, secure corporate training contracts and launch their next beautiful NOW!  Dropping Names Besides helping women entrepreneurs and business leaders, I also conduct corporate trainings, helping teams to create killer communication skills, craft messaging and understand how to pitch and build sales programs. I’m also a world-class speaker for global brands including: Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, George Washington University, Intuit Quickbooks, NBC Universal, PwC and more. Never one to forget my roots, I give back by working with organizations like Bottomless Closet, the Bowery Women’s Mission and Dress for Success.  Ain’t Nothing But Some Accolades I’m featured in a Mastercard “Priceless” commercial, am a 4-time Book of the Year Finalist, a Stevie Awards “Maverick of the Year” Silver Medalist, a 2021 Leadership in Action Awardee for Career Mastered and an ICABA 2021 Women of Impact Awardee.  As if that wasn’t enough, I’m also a 3-time #1 bestselling author for my books, Bad Bitches and Power Pitches: For Women Entrepreneurs and Speakers Only, and The Bad Bitches and Power Pitches Workbook, with my third, Pitching for Profit: The Bad Bitches’ Playbook to Convert Conversations into Currency, available now!  I’ve also appeared in Forbes Magazine, CNN, Wall Street Journal, and on a billboard in Times Square (pinch me!). But I’m truly nothing without the amazing women and businesses I help. Ya’ll inspire me on the daily.   The Tea on Precious  As a proud black woman, I graduated from Spelman College with a degree in English and then earned my JD from Rutgers Law School. I even practiced law for a hot second.

Contributor@Fast Co., Newsweek, Entrepreneur MY NEW BOOK, 'BE YOUR OWN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF': https://amzn.to/3q1PDwB -> featured in FORBES, USA TODAY and ENTREPRENEUR -- Fast-growth (Inc. 5000) CEOs, just like turn-around CEOs, often screw up their Talent Strategy, Operations + Digital Transformation (80% fail), benefits and systems, with high costs and disastrous results. They often have no real strategy or plan for acquiring, engaging or developing top talent, or growing and scaling.  Even if they're great at moving quickly and 'breaking things,' their rocket ship needs a battle-hardened HR leader on board. They are just 1 of a million *aspiring* 'best companies to work for' without a compelling employer brand, benefit strategy or employee experience.  That's where I come in. I help mission-driven enterprises to live and breathe their “Why” by building, growing and scaling world-class HR/People/Culture/Talent organizations and company cultures, empowering talent to do their life's best work in the here and now.  At HR, Talent & Systems, we engage with award-winning corporations and Inc. 5000 startups to transform how they do business by unlocking and unleashing their greatest asset (their people), creating a virtuous cycle of engaged employees and increased profitability.  Using our proven SDMI (strategy, design, motivation and implementation) framework, we help CEOs and C-suites delegate/automate/outsource effectively, improve and streamline internal communications, unclog information flow and empower data-driven decision-making.  To create a superlative Employee Experience (EX) and improve retention, engagement and development, we partner with trusted vendors to customize employee benefits for value and relevance, improve team dynamics and project management through coaching, measure and benchmark performance, provide Leadership & Development opportunities, as well as create clear job descriptions, career pathways and promotion/raise guidelines. Beyond traditional strategy consulting, “digital transformation” and 'change management' frameworks, we drive success for our clients through a high-touch, yet agile, human-first approach built on extensive operational experience in the Fortune 500 and VC-backed startups in HR, finance, sales and other functional areas.
