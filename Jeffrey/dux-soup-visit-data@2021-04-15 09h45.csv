She tells the story of how I convinced her that camping out on the floor while my friend used her bed for a week would be an adventure she would enjoy. Neither of us can remember what I said, but it clearly worked!  Apparently, it comes so naturally to me that I don't realize I'm creating a story. A brand narrative. Because when I believe in something, I will make you believe in it too!  I'm also extremely meticulous about following up with people. Getting back to you. Answering your questions. Replying to your inquiries.  I'm designed that way.  WHAT I DO I am a Managing Partner of a branding agency. I get to use my storytelling, communication and organization skills doing a job I love. Oh and did I mention I love beautiful things? I create beautiful stories that sell. At Expirit, I run a team of young, dedicated professionals that use a unique approach to design contemporary and engaging brands. Our Brooklyn office is a fun, collaborative environment.  I make it my business to handle your branding or marketing project from start to finish in a timely, professional and friendly manner.  MY LINKEDIN JOURNEY  A few months after I started my business, I was naturally looking to network and meet new potential clients.  After hearing my sister sing LinkedIn’s praises for months, I pulled up my LinkedIn profile from 10 years ago. I had 34 connections. After 3 months I got my first client through LinkedIn.

This led me to ultimately reaching the level of a global executive at two iconic companies, Johnson and Johnson and GE.  I truly learned how to develop and help individuals in achieving what they never thought was professionally possible, especially women and women of color.  I’ve been through the highs, lows and a crisis or two in Corporate America as a Black woman navigating to become a leader herself. I know what it really takes and it wasn't easy, but I was determined.    What these experiences also prepared and positioned me for was to become an expert in women’s leadership and the advancement of women and women of color into positions of leadership and authority in the workplace.  It prepared me to become the Founder and CEO of FrancineParham & Co., the holding company for the Sharpen Your Skills leadership and professional development programs and events. Also preparing me serve as a Senior Fellow at The Conference Board, a global think tank where my ideas and thoughts are important to move the agenda ahead for women and women of color in leadership. And most importantly to ensure that the right conversations and insights of other leaders and experts who are also committed to this work are heard on my channel, Advancing Women in the Workplace with FrancineParham and Co.   So, I hope that you can take away from all of my work and experiences of over two decades that I'm super focused on what women and women of color want and need to advance successfully in their careers. I’m continuing to share what I learned and know to help other women and women of color professionally advance as I did. I know that it takes more than just your technical skills and nothing is achieved alone. I’ve lived and practiced what I talk about and know to be the realities and the truths. I understand that it means being intentionally focused and most importantly learning and mastering the unwritten and unspoken skills needed for career advancement. Hence my work is designed and delivered to position women and women of color to be professionally successful by mastering those unwritten rules and unspoken skills.  And when I'm not helping with the advancement of women and women of color in the workplace, I'm spending time with my family, doing one of the things I love the most - writing and reading about so many interesting places l that I've learned about and hope to travel to one day, as well as engaging in meaningful conversations with longtime friends that I treasure and keep me grounded.","2017","Founder | CEO","FrancineParham & Co.

We have started a new, global Connected Insurance initiative to advance Internet of Things /Artificial Intelligence of Things (IoT/AIoT) related to solutions developed with ecosystem partners covering Workers' Safety, Flood, Wildfires and Aquaculture risks.  We are doing this by collaborating with great teams of people and ultimately, the goal is to make more families more resilient by delivering solutions that leverage what I call the 5 P's: Prevention, Pre-emption, Protection, Prediction and Prescriptive (analytics), at the right time with the least amount of friction in the process as possible.   Together, we can and will transform the fundamentals of the insurance business - by developing new models (business and algorithmic-based) that is passively provide digital risk services that prevent, preempt and protect against risks, that are supported by algorithm-based smart analytics that are proactively providing predictive and prescriptive capabilities, where new, dynamic value-based underwriting and pricing models can be introduced and become mainstream. I call this process “leveraging the 5 P’s”, which is essentially moving digital capabilities from business enabler to business driver to ultimately achieve data liquidity. I work closely with a lot of start-ups, including some that have become leaders in the InsurTech space. I encourage you to contact me and present your new InsureTech business plan that supports the efforts underway to transform of the P&C and/or Life and Health insurance industry.","2017","Managing Director, Chief Marketing Officer","IIP Group, LLC"," "," "," ","805-705-3978"," ","billtys7","New Canaan, Connecticut, United States","Information Technology and Services","Sent promote or fire article|Sent sales process blog","",

Then when they start making that compound and test the performance, they'll want to revisit the toxicity closer to commercializing. Giving a tool like ViridisChem’s Chemical Analyzer to R&D chemists empowers them to pay attention to toxicity during their daily work.” ____Dr. David Constable, Industry expert and Director of the ACS Green Chemistry Institute, and the author of more than 28 journal publications and books  “All scientists would prefer to avoid using toxic chemicals and minimize the health and ecological impact of the products they are creating.  Companies also see the obvious social and economic benefits in delivering products with minimum toxicity footprint. But easy access to toxicity information about the chemicals is a major problem. ViridisChem is addressing this critical problem and offers tremendous benefit to all the companies during early stages of product development.  ____Dr. Niteen A.

Napoleon Bonaparte.    Post - Ph.D., I spent 8 years working for Sigma-Aldrich, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (now Sanofi Aventis), and Applied Biosystems.  In 1996, I left Applied Biosystems to focus on my invention, the Ecological Funnel and I built a company around it, called #CPLabSafety. In December 2000, I founded NovaBay Pharmaceuticals.  In 2007, on the strength of our patented NVC-422 (Auriclosene) and NVC-101 (Avenova, NeutroPhase), and partnerships with Alcon-Novartis, KCI and later Galderma, my team and I, took the company public and along the way (2000-2015) we successfully raised ~$200 million from private, public and non-dilutive capital sources. In 2011, I formed Emery Pharma as a subsidiary of NovaBay. EMERY PHARMA In 2015, I took over Emery Pharma, and have since been expanding its capabilities, and moved the company from Emeryville to Alameda, CA (near San Francisco). My team and I built Emery Pharma as a company that can help early stage, 'seed funded' biopharma to Big Pharma, medical device, and cleantech companies with their R&D challenges.  Every day we face questions like: •	how do I quantitate XYZ compound in blood, urine...or does this compound have in-vitro / in-vivo activity? •	how do I know my compound is pure?  Or what is the impurity? •	How do I develop IP around my technology?  Emery Pharma can help! We have the instrumentation needed and more importantly the intellectual prowess that can figure out the toughest problems.   Over the last 20+ years our team has been exposed to multiple FDA clinical trials and have worked on medical devices from concept to FDA clearance.  We developed products such as: AVENOVA, NeutroPhase, CelleRx and built a 50 person commercial sales force in the USA to market AVENOVA. Those who know me well, understand my passion for innovation and my love for inventors who are aiming to save lives and save the environment.

I created Fulcrum Venture Accelerator to help fix this problem. After raising multiple rounds of financing at Kindara, I realized that instead of the disorganized approach that most founders take, I could take a systematic approach to raising capital.  I created a 5 step process for raising seed capital - Tilling, Planting, Watering, Harvesting, Closing. By defining the steps and following my own recipe, I not only knew exactly what to do at every step of my raise, I was also able to raise bigger and bigger rounds as Kindara grew.  After Prima-Temp acquired Kindara, I started helping friends raise seed rounds using the fundraising process I developed. I was excited to see that the process could be taught and applied successfully by entrepreneurs in different industries.  Running out of money is the #1 reason startups fail. I’ve seen many good companies fail because the founder wasn’t able to raise seed funding. Many founders go about the fundraising process in a disorganized and scattered way, or worse they don’t follow a process at all, and they end up wasting a huge amount of time and come up empty handed.  Of course this isn’t their fault, because nobody has been teaching founders a proven process to raise seed funding, and walking them through the steps until now.  In 2020 I founded Fulcrum, a fundraising accelerator for mission-driven entrepreneurs. Every quarter we look for the best companies with a positive social mission, and put them through a rigorous process of fundraising development to help them execute on their raise. We spend time making sure founders understand the process at a deep level, and execute a successful fundraise so they can close their round and get on with building their company.   I like to remind founders that they can delegate marketing, product, finance, customer support, operations, manufacturing, and design, but they can’t delegate fundraising. For this reason becoming excellent at fundraising can massively turbo-charge what a given founder is able to accomplish and the difference they are able to make.  We help our founders be among the top 1% of entrepreneurs when it comes to raising money. To date more than $20M in pre-seed and seed capital has been raised using our process. We look for high-caliber founders who are building something impactful and who are currently raising (or about to be raising) seed capital.

This includes quality service that in the past may have been only available to high-net-worth individuals. As a fee-only advisor and fiduciary, I have an obligation to represent the interests of my clients first and foremost.  MY VISION: My vision in starting my own full-service wealth management firm after working for so many years in large broker-dealers was to provide business owners and the individual investor with best-in-class guidance and disciplined execution. Today, I work with clients from all over the United States to facilitate achievement of their financial goals whether that be wealth accumulation or financial planning. My strength is my skill in portfolio management whether working with modest investors just starting out, more established clients with greater assets or wealthier individuals looking for a better experience. MY STRENGTH: I build portfolios that graduate and grow with each client as they evolve in their life while still providing a high level of service that is essential in good relationships. I enjoy working with clients, earning their trust, developing an understanding of what matters most and helping clients meet the financial challenges that come with every stage of life. For me, it's a privilege and an honor to be trusted by clients large and small. The common denominator is always the same--authenticity and honesty in working with clients and delivery of a quality experience regardless of the size of the assets under management. MY AREAS OF EXPERTISE:  ● Fee-Only/Fiduciary ● Investment Strategies ● Investment Advisory Services ● Wealth Management ● Portfolio Management ● Stock Selection LET'S CONNECT: I would be eager to speak with prospective clients, colleagues and other professionals for networking or to establish mutual purpose. The best way to reach me is via LinkedIn or email at Kurt@ZenithCapital.us. Even better, schedule a time to talk on www.Calendly.com/KurtFetter. I look forward to connecting!

She quickly discovered that cellular agriculture research was not held back by a lack of interest or expertise, but instead by a lack of designated funding channels directed at this intersectional work. Thus began her quest to establish the field of animal products made without animals, one recognized by researchers, funding agencies, and investors. A stint in Policy and Public Affairs at GlaxoSmithKline illuminated the cooperative relationship between non-profits, academia, and companies in translating beneficial science out of the lab and into society. Isha has used a model established in the advancement of medical research to accelerate cellular agriculture, by funding early stage, foundational research in academia in order for ready-to-market technologies to be developed for commercial use. Isha became Executive Director of New Harvest in January 2013.

My vibrant and energetic friend suffered from mouth sores that made eating painful, resulting in rapid weight loss and, ultimately, succumbing to his cancer.  His family and friends searched, but did not find, safe and clinically appropriate symptom management support.  I thought that if this could happen to Eric and his family, it must be happening to many people. I left my career on Wall Street and spent two years researching the scientific literature regarding the symptom and side effects experienced by cancer patients and interviewing cancer patients, caregivers, and the medical professionals who treat them so that I could create a solution to address these unmet needs in a scientific and clinically appropriate manner.  I found that nutritional strategies are effective in managing the symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment and represent an effective lever to improve outcomes and lower cost of care.  The result of this research is Ina ®, a virtual 'Intelligent Nutrition Assistant' chatbot who provides personalized nutritional strategies for symptom management 24/7 'on demand' via SMS text on a smartphone.  Licensed by healthcare enterprises and provided free of charge to cancer patients and caregivers, Ina ®, provides the support Eric and his family were searching for.

You’re working in your day job, but find yourself constantly thinking about your passion. You want to make a change, and go all-in, but you can’t because you’re in need of a paycheck, or health insurance. DOES THIS STORY SOUND FAMILIAR? Don’t worry, because that was me, too — I was in your shoes. And lived it for MANY years. Then, in March 2020, just as the Coronavirus outbreak was occurring, my corporate job threw me a curveball, & vanished. It was an epiphany moment, & for the first time in 30 years, I was able to put all of my focus and attention into my business; helping my clients.  So how might this impact you?  You may be an expert in your industry, but nobody knows it… OR You may be a one-person show, & don’t have the capacity to produce content… OR Your company gets ignored because the competition outspends you. THIS USED TO BE THE CASE FOR MY CLIENTS WHO WERE: A.) People who don’t know how to find their voice or share their story effectively through writing and/ or video. B.) People who realize that writing and video is critical to their growth, but avoid the camera, or avoid expressing their views on paper. C.) People who realize writing and video is critical to their business, but lack the time or skills to execute. Where do you fall? How can you have a voice and share your story if you’re not visible, and how will people get to know you if you’re silent? They can't, it’s impossible. BUT, I can help you amplify your voice, plus shape and deliver your story through the art of writing and the craft of world class video. I realize that doing this the proper way takes time and energy, and that’s where our team of experts come in to serve you, with a common goal to generate countless leads for your business. WHO I SERVE: Entrepreneurs, Business Executives, Authors, Public Speakers, & Businesses looking for visibility, but are frustrated with paying high fees with little to no results.

I am a graduate from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt. Throughout my career, as a partner in private practice and in my current role, I have represented governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, as well as publicly-held Fortune 100 companies. I am honored to have been recognized as a Trailblazer by the New York Law Journal for being an 'agent of change, thought leader and innovator.'  For the past ten years, I have managed the Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) litigation on behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and various Federal Home Loan banks. Before that, I handled discovery management in the Bernie Madoff bankruptcy litigation. Outside the office, I sit on the Board of Birch Family Services, the Advisory Board of Higher Talent, and the Advisory Board of Merlin OpenSource Foundation. At Karta Legal, I have assembled an entire ecosystem to help organizations in their legal innovation journey. In my team, I have experts in change management, process improvement and mapping, technology, AI, cybersecurity, data science, e-discovery, project management, and litigation support. We know what works, what doesn't, and how much it should cost.  My goal is innovation and re-designing the delivery of legal services. The path to innovation is simple. First, focus on the people. Second, design or redesign the process. Third, pick the right technology for your specific needs and your budget. To achieve those goals, I use a variety of design thinking and business process improvement tools selected from Lean Six Sigma and Agile Project Management methodologies. Over the years, I have curated and tailored these tools to fit the needs of the legal industry and have applied them successfully. When asked to describe myself I say I am part: lawyer, process maven, technologist, educator, Lean Six Sigma facilitator, and innovation driver. Why should lawyers change the way we deliver legal services to our clients? The most fundamental reason is because we are duty bound to do so. We have professional, ethical, and fiduciary duties to continuously strive to eliminate the pervasive waste that exists in many of our legal processes, increasing the value of those services and ensuring data security in the process.

An international digital, design and content agency supporting clients in the life science space across the world. Today, I live in Boston - the epicentre of global drug development.  And I'm a proud keynote speaker, podcaster, blogger, guest lecturer and Forbes Agency Council Member. During my career, I’ve had the privilege of working with and advising over 60 brands in the life science supply chain globally on comms, digital marketing and creative strategy. Biotech, pharma, CMOs, CDMOs, CROs, CPOs, tech, equipment, testing firms - the lot.  As the team has expanded, my job has gone from doing the doing, to growing and leading the company, globally. This has been a tad stressful at times but a tremendously enjoyable ride. Our multi-award-winning company has offices in Newcastle and Manchester, UK and Cambridge/Boston, Mass, USA. So, what does ramarketing do? We’re in the business of helping fast-growing companies in the life science (pharmaceutical and biotech) sectors get noticed. We now work with some of the biggest names and fastest growing companies in the drug development supply chain. By helping clients unearth what makes them different, we enable them to raise profile, demonstrate expertise and secure inbound leads through a combination of tactics such as design, web, content, search and social. If our clients grow and succeed, then so do we. It’s pretty simple. One of the things I am most proud of is the team and the culture I have nurtured at ramarketing. I simply love my staff. They are awesome. We pay people well and give them a flexible work-life balance, which translates into a client-focused workforce and high staff retention. We're an agency driven by collective purpose and enjoyment, not money. We have as culture with genuine soul and personality. Today, I am as thirsty as ever for knowledge in a bid perfect my craft, grow the business and help more brands. I'm a keynote speaker at various business events and conferences.

Catapulted from a junior management position at BA, an MBA, and into the world of fiber optics, which ultimately led me to the USA in ‘94, and a Masters in International Mass Communications (MIMC) at Northwestern.  Then staying this side of the 'pond, ' into the world of media, local radio,  and then TV as producer/presenter.  Then returning to global marketing as SVP Marketing & Operations at the Fortune 500 George P.Johnson Group, where they sponsored my board position of the World Trade Centers Association in NYC. After the devastating life-changing events of  9/11, the entire trajectory of my career changed, and I morphed into real estate Jan 2002. I've never looked back.  In 2012 I founded the first cloud brokerage on the east coast,  Global Property Systems (GPS). Determined to disrupt the norms of traditional real estate by embracing technology, developing marketing and support teams to provide systems to our local & global “boots on the ground” Realtors, and superior services to all of our clients.  GPS is thriving by doing real estate differently. We are now operating on 3 continents. Our corporate relocation division works directly with executives by removing 3rd party costs and middlemen.  Our commercial division has evolved into an exciting world of global investment opportunities providing fractional investment opportunities, golden visa citizenship opportunities, and global marketing services to international developers, all secured by our blockchain capabilities.  Our boutique residential brokerage excels due to extraordinary teamwork, providing a team of marketing, real estate, and technology professionals fully focused on our clients' needs. As an Industry Influencer and Blockchain Advisor, I consult to Consortia.realestate as a Board Member and SolidBlock.co as Advisory Board Member providing fractional ownership by tokenization and optimized referral relationships made possible via blockchain technology. Currently, as Secretary-General of FIABCI global communications, speaker, and trainer, I present globally, discussing developments in global marketing and communications, blockchain, crypto assets, and international escrow.  In a nutshell. I live by the following mantra:  'If you don't think you're ever out of your depth, you aren't pushing yourself far enough.' I do hope you really want to connect, and not just sell me something. If so, I look forward to hearing from you.

I was Director of Business Strategy & Development at Oncobiologics, Inc., and have held Business Development roles in Contract Research Organizations. My business development experience includes Sales, Licensing, Alliance Management and Contract Negotiation. As a consultant through SP Pharma Consulting LLC, I’ve provided strategic advice to biotech companies in new technology development and evaluation, technology due diligence and antifungal drug R&D.  At Merck & Co., I worked in drug discovery and preclinical development programs in therapeutic areas including infectious disease/antifungals, immunology and inflammation and sepsis. My group investigated the antifungal properties of the immunosuppressant FK-506, and played important roles identifying and characterizing FKS genes in budding yeast. Yeast Fks proteins are subunits of fungal beta-1,3-glucan synthase (GS), and targets of the first-in-class echinocandin drug CANCIDAS®. My lab also identified and characterized a murine gene encoding a C-type lectin expressed in subsets of immune sentinel dendritic cells. C-type lectins play important roles in pathogen pattern recognition, and regulation of host responses to bacteria, fungi and viruses.

I have an ongoing commitment to making certain that only the safest and most effective drugs, devices and biologics find their way to the patient, because the patient is waiting. That’s the motivation that drives my passion for what I do each and every day. My work as an Auditing Systems Strategist, and that of everyone at ClinAudits, helps companies compile and submit data to regulatory bodies for approval in an accurate and efficient way. As a Certified Women-Owned Business Enterprise, I’m proud of the work we have done at ClinAudits since I founded it in 1994. We have served clients across the entire spectrum of the regulated Pharmaceutical industry: biotechnology, biologic, gene therapy, tissue engineering, medical device industries, OTC and RX. Operating strictly within the regulations/guidelines set forth by the FDA and other worldwide regulatory authorities, our efforts are focused on satisfying end-to-end FDA and other governmental regulatory authority GxP compliance requirements around the world. During my career I’ve had the good fortune to work with, and for, countless outstanding professionals in our industry. Early on, I recognized that collaboration and partnership were vital in advancing the life sciences. This awareness spurred my involvement as a speaker and panelist at industry conferences, participating in panel and round-table discussions on topics that are important to fellow auditors and industry colleagues. Beyond my passion for improving the lives of people, lies a passion for other living things. Living plants to be more precise. As a Certified Master Gardener, I love bringing the same detail and care to learning about and growing plants as I do to auditing. As I see it, it’s all about life. Protecting it. Improving it.

A few growth stories I've been fortunate to play a part in: ➡️ Lafayette 148 where eCommerce revenue grew from $8MM annually to $45MM in a 4.5 year period. ➡️ Ecru which experienced 580% online sales growth turning into a multi-million dollar luxury fashion brand. ➡️ Fine Accoutrements, a men's grooming brand which has broken monthly sales records for 14 straight months (and counting), all without any significant digital advertising. ➡️  Multiple clients recently have hit all-time highs/ record months already during the 2020 holiday season.    My 21 years of digital experience comes from a wide range of verticals: Lafayette 148 New York (fashion), 92nd Street Y (not-for-profit), Rita Hazan (beauty), Le Cordon Bleu culinary (food), and much more. A little bit about Needle Movement: We specialize in digital marketing for emerging brands. And especially 😍 conversation marketing. Conversation commerce is the next wave of marketing and we’re in the early innings. Email is crushing it, SMS is just catching on and Messenger is the first of many more platforms that are enabling chat commerce.  Needle Movement works with retail brands to get them on board first. We take care of setting up each platform, matching brand voice and building out the automation flows.  And while most brands are already doing emai marketing, our engagements are designed to unlock money that's being left on the table.  We offer different engagements to match company needs and budgets. Some brands benefit from outside expertise for a few months and others need a full engagement to check all the boxes for them.  Message me on LinkedIn to hear more about how we can help your brand.   We’re especially interested in working with purpose-driven brands that stand for something and want to use their powers for good.  _______________________________________________________________________________________ I have presented at conferences including Luxury Interactive and SearchCon on the topics of conversation marketing, conscious eCommerce and email strategy.  Available for speaking engagements: panel discussions, virtual summits, podcasts, seminars.

She brings a blend of large pharmaceutical operational expertise, venture investment background and entrepreneurship to Amydis. Dr. Sarraf is viewed as a visionary with a deep understanding of “cradle to grave” and the necessary components to achieve success from product concept through to commercialization. Previously, she spent 10 years in Venture Capital at Foresite Capital Management and Prospect Venture Partners, both growth capital healthcare funds with over $2B dollars in assets under management. There she led science, regulatory and commercial diligence on more than 700 investment opportunities from companies in therapeutic and diagnostic areas. Some successful investments and exits by Foresite with Stella’s leadership included Auspex Pharmaceuticals (sold to Teva for $3.5B in 2015) and Wavetec Vision (sold to Alcon in 2014).  Earlier in her career, Dr. Sarraf worked at Merck in Rahway, New Jersey as a senior research chemist responsible for creating the chemical synthesis of novel drug candidates for translation from the bench to clinical production. Most recently in 2016, Dr. Sarraf founded Spinogenix which is focused on developing novel neurorestorative therapeutics to combat neurological diseases with synaptic dysfunction, some of which include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s and Traumatic Brain Injury.  Dr. Sarraf holds a PhD in organic chemistry from Columbia University and earned a BA in biochemistry and molecular biology from the University of California, Berkeley.

Aurora is going to provide compounds in any format for free, synthesis and providing of hits and leads also for free. How do the partners benefit from collaboration with Aurora? Aurora's drug repositioning program contains a database of 18,000 drugs registered in the USA, Europe, Japan and other countries/parts of the world that allows a quick approval process and speedy commercialization for known drugs having the new or different indications. On the other hand, due the extraordinary large compound collection (18.1 mln.) almost unlimited source of structures for drug research and development is available. Aurora's approach has proven successful for virus and neurological disorders projects with NIH agencies in the USA. Why Aurora's looking for additional partners? Aurora's cooperation with NIH agencies based on cutting edge technology for in vitro, in vivo and in some cases clinical study provides the very good quality hits and leads. In the light of encouraging results we'd like to invite you to participate in drug development projects.  Aurora is looking for additional providers for in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. The partners should be able to fulfill the preclinical studies including in vitro and/or in vivo testing. How to join our partnership? The obtained results will be available to the partners and shared jointly. The intellectual property must be protected by jointly owned patents and drafting of legal documents to avoid pitfalls. The joint venture agreement (or Memorandum of Understanding) should be signed by partners who want to enter into a project together.

My main interest is to invent/develop novel chemical technologies and apply them to the biological field and drug innovation. This interest spurred me to start CellMosaic in 2008 after working for four and a half years in the biotech industry. Although my previous work resulted in a few patents, none of those inventions can be turned into a real value-added product for society. CellMosaic gives me a platform where I can invent and apply my technology to create value for society.  Through CellMosaic’s platform, I have developed the core advanced conjugation process for custom bioconjugation services and commercialized a personalized conjugation kit (PerKit™) and many other bioconjugation-related products based on these processes. One example is the antibody-drug conjugation (ADC) kits that allow customers to perform conjugation in their own labs. Since their launch in 2018, ADC kits have been used successfully by many laboratories. Seeing the direct outcome of my work gives me real joy and motivation to invent more and build/commercialize more products for my customers.  I am also the sole inventor of sugar alcohol-based AqueaTether (AqT™) linkers and other crosslinking and MS-Tag technologies, such as OxLink™, SxLink™, and NeIon™.

This new facility will allow Nanotronics' artificial intelligence researchers, computer scientists, chemists, and physicists to work directly with skilled machinists on the manufacturing floor to develop innovations that will lead partner industries to a smaller factory footprint, producing less waste while bolstering speed from R&D to production. Nanotronics’ new facility is projected to be completed by Q2/Q3 2020 and aims to serve as the blueprint for modern manufacturing.  Matthew was the President of Tech Pro Inc, maker of data acquisition software, and physical testing equipment for various industries.

We spent money where it counted and bargain shopped for others. My Dollar Tree DIY crafting came in handy for getting the office quickly stocked and decorated. I even got kudos from a recent new hire on the labeling of the cabinets in the kitchen area.   Never underestimate the impact of seemingly small details.

They often have no real strategy or plan for acquiring, engaging or developing top talent, or growing and scaling.  Even if they're great at moving quickly and 'breaking things,' their rocket ship needs a battle-hardened HR leader on board. They are just 1 of a million *aspiring* 'best companies to work for' without a compelling employer brand, benefit strategy or employee experience.  That's where I come in. I help mission-driven enterprises to live and breathe their “Why” by building, growing and scaling world-class HR/People/Culture/Talent organizations and company cultures, empowering talent to do their life's best work in the here and now.  At HR, Talent & Systems, we engage with award-winning corporations and Inc. 5000 startups to transform how they do business by unlocking and unleashing their greatest asset (their people), creating a virtuous cycle of engaged employees and increased profitability.  Using our proven SDMI (strategy, design, motivation and implementation) framework, we help CEOs and C-suites delegate/automate/outsource effectively, improve and streamline internal communications, unclog information flow and empower data-driven decision-making.  To create a superlative Employee Experience (EX) and improve retention, engagement and development, we partner with trusted vendors to customize employee benefits for value and relevance, improve team dynamics and project management through coaching, measure and benchmark performance, provide Leadership & Development opportunities, as well as create clear job descriptions, career pathways and promotion/raise guidelines.

After successfully implementing the necessary processes I moved internally at Roche to lead the clinical supply packaging and labeling group.

In 2006, I started the Quality Risk Management (QRM) project at Roche, which was implemented in 2009. End of 2011 I co-founded Widler & Schiemann AG, a Management Consulting firm specializing supporting their clients in drug development.

Since then, I have channeled my love of science into a career in biotech and pharma, working to help commercialize new pharmaceutical products from preclinical development along the product life cycle. My experience varies from global pharmaceutical marketing and sales to data analytics for both small and top-ten pharmaceutical companies, where I have been fortunate enough to gain a thorough understanding of the pharmaceutical commercialization process. I have recently decided to return to my 'scientific' roots, and have begin working with pharmaceutical companies in the clinical trial stages.  Currently, I am working as an Account Executive with Bioclinica where I connect pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the Midwest to Bioclinica's portfolio of integrated technology solutions and software for clinical trial management.

Here, I am honored to serve customers in almost 100 countries worldwide, together with our amazing Sciencix family! Along with a background as a trained Chemist, my time here has taught me that when an organization combines the elements of People, Purpose, Product, and Provision, then Perfection (5 Ps) is Possible.  Not that we have attained it, but the Pursuit is on! The most valuable asset for any organization is its People. The company’s success is directly proportional to its people being successful. As we surround ourselves with People that have great Purpose, working together on quality Products, with adequate Provision, the results speak for themselves.  In addition, I believe that everyone needs LAND. Love, Attention, Nurturing, Direction. When purpose driven people are given LAND, their landscapes are beautiful to behold! And yes, some of us might need an ISLAND (Immense Serving of Love, Attention, Nurturing, Direction) which I have personally received many times over, and now enjoy giving back as the opportunity arises.
