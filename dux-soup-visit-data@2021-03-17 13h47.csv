Technology scaleup marketing grows at an incredible rate. You can initiate new activities, launch campaigns, take on agencies, and hire marketers at speed.  It’s tough to keep control of activity, resources value, or expenditure.  Budget is wasted. Efforts are wasted. Agency relationships deteriorate.  Too often marketing simply doesn’t drive the value and sales you want and need to meet your commitments.  When you make uninformed marketing choices, opportunities are missed. Events are lacklustre. Messages fall short. The wrong agencies are hired. Channels and tactics don't reach the audience.  I created services to help fast growing tech startups and scaleups to avoid exactly these issues.  They aim to help you make SMARTER CHOICES, gain and keep CONTROL & VISIBILITY, and conduct EFFECTIVE MARKETING for your business.   ♦ Marketing advice sessions and services to guide smarter choices of marketing directions and resources ♦ Marketing control as a service to help you monitor and manage marketing value and performance ♦ Marketing consulting services to meet your strategic priorities ♦ Marketing execution services to help you take action – or find the RIGHT resources to take action, via our network of partners and contacts or via knowledgeable agency search and pitch management.

Your Local Buzz delivers all this support, with online and offline marketing packages for established and new businesses alike. We all know the saying, “People buy off people that they know, like and trust”. Local Buzz Magazine helps to create that trust and credibility for your business through regular features in our media campaigns If you have ambitious plans for business growth, we can partner up with you and help you to achieve those goals.     Local Buzz is an engaging, glossy, award-winning FREE magazine filled with news articles about the local community, business features, advertisements and competitions. Local Buzz has that WOW factor. Your message would be viewed by: -	5.0m impressions by 2.5m users in Facebook in a year -	75,000 readers six times throughout the year – we distribute 20,000 professionally published copies to local homes and businesses  -	over 17M potential reach p.a. -       Over 30k new visits on our website  The experience of one of our advertisers is very typical: Before I started with Local Buzz, I was struggling along with a few clients and wondering whether I was going to make ends meet. With the publication of your great magazine, my telephone hardly stopped ringing. I had 19 responses – more than enough for a small business like mine. And fantastic quality leads they are, too – so far all but one has converted to be new customers. I couldn’t even dream of a conversion rate like that when I was a sales manager in previous companies!

Success in the creative industry isn’t easy, especially as, year by year, it becomes ever more saturated. I love working with businesses who have lost their voice. Where the messaging no longer fits with their presence. They've outgrown themselves and need help to get back on track. This is my story. I set my sights firmly on running my own company back in 2008, and some ten years on, that dream has come true. At aged 19, I was identified as having dyslexia. As a result, most things don’t come easily to me - but in response, I fight twice as hard. I also surround myself with successful people who inspire me on a daily basis.  After graduating in 2008, I struggled to secure my first job in the field that I’d chosen. I needed an opportunity but lacked in confidence and experience. And with that, Kimberley-Jane Design was born. I had the vision to work with small Start-Ups to help them “hit the ground running” with a slick brand and an array of printed materials. What began as a venture to build a portfolio and gain experience, would eventually turn into Squibble. These early experiences sparked a passion and a hunger to succeed. Knock back after knock back left me with something to prove.  Ten years on, Squibble is a multi-award-winning agency with a client portfolio that spans the globe.  My favorite quote: 'I never dreamed about success. I worked for it.' #webdesign #webdesignagency #creativeagency #branding #logodesign #graphicdesign","2021","Chairperson","Downtown in Business","https://www.linkedin.com/company/481675","https://linktr.ee/DowntownInBusiness"," "," "," ","KJDesignLtd","England, United Kingdom","Marketing and Advertising","|🦆-default-invited","",

Currently working in the fastest growing and most extensive industry in the world - Cyber Security.  I have extensive knowledge of platforms in Cyber Security, Document Management and Client Extranet arenas.  As a Business Development and Social Media Marketing Specialist some of my high profile clients have included both on-shore and off-shore financial and legal organisations.   I have had positions as a Business Development Manager and Senior Account Manager over the last 8 years and having come from studying Business Management at the University Of Kent where I graduated with honours, this definitely assisted me. During this time I was fortunate enough to take on work experience and also part-time roles at various major organisations such as Credit Suisse. Since the time of carrying out work experience I have always been involved with B2B and B2C marketing and active selling, through various campaigns. Colleagues know me as a an extremely hard-working, diligent and entrepreneurial individual with the tenacity and resilience for achieving only the highest results. Compulsory in any sales based role. I truly believe that that the business comes first and always make sure to advise based on the business strategy and future aspirations. When dealing with my clients whether on a new business or current client set-up, I always strive to give them the best advice with the utmost confidentiality and trust. In summary my qualifications from school, in particular my A-Levels in Economics set a good ground and basis for my university degree in Business Management where a true and real understanding of the business world were formed. My work experience helped give me more real world experience to the highest quality in client facing roles.

While neither email or telephony are new, our integrated approach is. We advocate a collaborative process that creates a powerful and effective tool for generating new business, at speed. My teams provide clients like CA, Ring Central, Equinix, VMware, IBM, Sainsbury's and M&S with award-winning, innovative campaigns that produce real ROI compared to traditional marketing methods.  These techniques deliver results way in excess of the norm. In fact, as the marketing landscape becomes increasingly complex and splintered, our results get better and better. As a designer, writer and marketer with over thirty years’ experience in all communications media, I have held marketing, communications and sales roles for organisations of all sizes. In 2007 I co-formed Industry, building a business that has grown from strength-to-strength.

They do expect you to fix things when they go wrong. No matter how great the reputation, all organisations are only as good as today’s performance. For over 30 years, I have helped organisations to increase employee engagement, understand their customers’ expectations and develop their employees’ skills sets. Prior to establishing MSB, I worked closely with British Airways Chief Executive Colin Marshall on the ‘Putting People First’ Culture Change strategy which transformed British Airways from a widely disparaged, deficit-ridden government-run entity into one of the world’s most profitable airlines in the 1980s. For the last 10 years, in addition to its UK and US client portfolio in healthcare and aviation, MSB has partnered with organisations in the Gulf. We have undertaken projects ranging from performance audits and leadership development programmes to employee engagement research and culture change strategies. My strong links with Lancaster University’s 6* Business School, one of just two in the UK, ensures that MSB remains at the cutting edge of employee engagement, customer satisfaction, and culture change research and practice. Through our strategic partnership with LUMS, we provide accredited training courses for clients. MSB’s business over 30 years is founded on three core values; Trust, Fairness and Loyalty.

Intelligent, analytical, insightful, inventive, innovative, creative solution-finders who love to nibble away at the knotty problems that rob the world of more and better. This they achieve by chipping away at complexity until fresh-faced, elegant simplicity emerges beneath. Problems are IE's bread and butter. Brand problems. Digital problems.

Over the years I’ve got to know what works and what doesn’t. In particular, client relationships - ensuring that we provide a hassle-free, trustworthy solution. If we get those bits right i.e keeping the customers we’ve got, our business grows and many other customers come our way as a result. Today, Countrywide is a well known regional Pest Control business and we have also expanded into associated hygiene and specialist cleaning services. We’re very fortunate to have a growing successful team of employees who excel at what they do, some of whom have been with us for many years. In addition to Countrywide, I am the current President of the British Pest Control Association and a keen supporter of small businesses with my business investing activities with Synergy Business Partners. WHAT NOW Countrywide - Connect with me on LinkedIn and let me know how you would like me to review your pest control service contract.

If so, you’ll be pleased to hear that providing your users with a great experience every time, is the best brand differentiator and marketing money can’t buy!   I help businesses overcome complex problems and define strategies to benefit their users. I have a passion for taking business goals and translating them into great looking user centered products.   I've worked with hundreds of clients and I am an advocate of the iterative cycle and constant improvements that the process yields. I also write for specialist publications like Optimizely and InVision.   My typical workflow involves working with clients to understand their business needs before carrying out competitor research, creating user stories and journeys, wireframing, qualitative usability testing, interactive prototyping and hi fidelity UI design. Then further user testing, and ongoing iteration to improve users’ experience based on the results. I regularly work directly with developers, handing over requirements and quality checking.   I choose to work with businesses with an established client base, and only those interested in establishing an ongoing relationship. It’s important to me to work with clients who understand the importance of investing in user experience long term for continuous improvement.    I take on a very limited number of projects at any one time so I can give each project the dedication that it needs. My ideal client is a startup or growing business with paying customers who’s looking for a long term UX relationship, and can commit to at least 7 days work per month for at least 6 months. I currently have space to take on just one more client.   If that sounds like you and you’re a founder or product manager looking to improve your current users’ experience or refine your UX process, let's talk, I’d love to hear from you!","2015","Managing Director","Tom Starley UX/UI Consultancy"," "," "," "," "," ","TomStarley","West Midlands, England, United Kingdom","Design","|🦆-default-invited","",

Traditional agencies that operate in silos, deliver commoditised products and transactional services have reached a ceiling they can not break through. Equally, traditional consultancies who walk away once their recommendations and reports are submitted because they are unable to effectively apply, oversee and realise their strategies in the real-world are in question. Individually, their influence is limited. Their remit is narrow. And, their time is up.  Challenging boundaries, breaking convention and solving problems in exciting new ways have become second nature to me. Now, as MD of Wyatt International – a group of bilateral B2B experts that collaborate and combine to occupy a unique space as both consultancy and agency – I use this pioneering outlook to shape how my team and I accelerate digitalisation, transform performance, drive growth and create value for business brands operating in industrial, construction, materials, technology, healthcare, financial and energy sectors all over the world.   A first-class BA (Hons) creative comms graduate and an alumni of Cambridge Judge Business School (Exec Education), I began my career as creative - designer then art director - working in London for B2B technology brands such as Logica, Unisys and Apple and B2C clients like Cadburys, EA Sports and Lucas Arts. Switching to employer branding and digital marketing in late 2000, I rose from Creative Director to Executive Creative Director for TMP Worldwide developing integrated, brand-led and award-winning strategies for leading organisations such as E.ON, LTSB, JLR, The Ford Motor Company, Bombardier, Miele, Yell.com, GCHQ, Vision Express and the NHS.  Joining Wyatt in 2010, my role initially focused on developing our digital offer, improving strategic thinking and increasing the quality of creativity across the business but this quickly evolved to include a wider remit: namely, to dissolve boundaries between our services and create a seamlessly integrated offer for our expanding global client-base.  Since then, I have repositioned our brand, re-engineered our structure and refocused our strategy so that we can continue to adapt, evolve and deliver high-value business brand consultancy services seamlessly alongside world-class, audience-first digital activation. During my career, I have realised over 60 industry awards and 7 UK marketing firsts.","2019","Managing Director","Wyatt International","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1241801","http://www.wyattinternational.com"," "," "," ","markfones","West Midlands, England, United Kingdom","Marketing and Advertising","|🦆-default-invited","",

We were delighted to win Best Mortgage Club at the 2020 Financial Reporter Awards, the 2018 & 2019 Mortgage Strategy Awards, Best Mortgage Club at The Mortgage Awards 2018 from MoneyAge, and personally, to have been awarded Business Leader: Mortgage Club at the 2018 British Mortgage Awards. Why use Paradigm Mortgage Services? There are many benefits for DA firms to use Paradigm, including the extensive support we offer from helping place difficult mortgage cases to preparing for regulatory changes. Our proc fees are competitive and we have an extensive WOM lending panel. A key advantage to members is the unique and transparent Profit Share scheme - where, from any retained element outside of the market leading proc fee we pay you, we unconditionally share 50%, i.e. a further payment back to you, so you will certainly earn more per case via Paradigm.  What is Paradigm Protect? Paradigm Protect launched in 2014 with the aim of becoming the Protection Distributor of choice for DA firms with an extensive range of products, a comprehensive website, a Protection Helpdesk service, regular CPD events and offering market leading commercial terms. We also see significant opportunities to improve our proposition going forward. We are focused on helping our firms write more business and have a comprehensive website, designed to support firms whether they are writing protection business already or want our help to start.

After five years commuting whilst freelancing at agencies in London, I decided there must be a better way. My entrepreneurial nature led me to start my first design business at the age of 24, which I ran successfully with a business partner for 7 years.   I then decided to start a new company on my own in 2006 (CLD). Since then it has grown to include a number of prestigious blue chip clients and a team of 15 full-time designers, developers, project managers and digital marketers.

Prior to starting my own businesses, I built up extensive commercial experience in my career, which primarily focused on building effective sales teams, business transformation and graduate recruitment - these are areas that I am still passionate about, and are at the forefront of Discovery’s expertise. It was also during these roles I realised that whilst people are a business’ biggest asset, they are often also the biggest barrier to growth. The solution? Helping businesses to make their recruitment & training more effective and strategic. I founded Discovery upon my belief that reactive recruitment or training usually addresses the symptoms of a challenge rather than the challenge itself, costing businesses more in the long-run. By adopting a diagnostic approach, Discovery’s experts solve these problems once and for all, and reduce an organisation’s total cost of workforce ownership along the way. It’s what the team at Discovery and I have come to call 'The Discovery Way'.","1999","CEO","Discovery","https://www.linkedin.com/company/646186","https://www.thediscoveryway.com"," "," "," "," ","Birmingham, England, United Kingdom","Staffing and Recruiting","|🦆-default-invited","",

In the six years in which she ran her former company Monochrome Express, Una worked with clients in a range of business sectors and areas including Customer Care, Accounts and Sales in the public and private sectors. Una Brown is creative, determined and passionate about helping her clients grow their businesses and the OPD service is highly personal and tailored to clients’ needs whether they are large or small. OPD’s aims are to increase clients’ sales activity through their existing customer base and by generating new, quality leads. Clients work with OPD both on continuous business generation programmes but also on ad hoc or one-off projects. Clients have the benefit of being able to “switch on” an affordable service as they need it, saving them time and money and as the proof of the pudding is in the eating – the investment OPD clients make is completely measurable and manageable.  Research evidence shows that many companies fail to meet their sales and profit potential simply because they do not recognise the value of their customer data to their business. They assume that their people are their greatest asset, and while they are of course, incredibly important, customers are even more important. Other People’s Data  specialises in helping companies to maximise the benefits of their own GDPR Compliant databases by helping them mine the richness of their data. Other Peoples Data works with clients to ensure the data they hold is accurate, meaningful and above all – useful.

How did I get to this position? First, I started as a Teacher of Business and Economics.  I loved teaching and I love education. Education is the driving force of future economic growth and social prosperity. Education is, in my mind, a key driver of human evolution: we become more suited to our environment the better educated we are. Education increases our chances of survival as a species. Then in January 2010 a position opened up for Branch Manager of Now Career's Education division. I was offered the position and with no previous experience in sales or recruitment, I jumped at the opportunity and grabbed it with both hands. Why? Because a) a change of career would help develop me as a person and b) this particular career would mean I get the chance to help schools do what has always been a difficult task: find and retain good teaching and support staff.  In 2012, Now Education became a separate LTD company and after growing and running a desk for 6 years as well as growing and running a thriving business, I moved away from a billing/manager role and into full-time leadership of Now Education. I do not lead a KPI driven business.  I lead a business which plans its sales activities based on goals and targets. I lead a business which uses data drive the training and development of its team. I lead a team of dedicated, passionate people who believe in delivering outstanding education through outstanding recruitment.  If being part of a business like that excites you, call me on 0121 452 4443.","2010","Managing Director","Now Education Ltd"," "," "," "," "," "," ","West Midlands, England, United Kingdom","Staffing and Recruiting","|🦆-default-invited","",

I have over twenty years experience gained in the tech space working for a number of leading US and UK enterprise software providers from publicly listed to start-ups.  This has driven my experience through all levels and disciplines having joined tech start-ups to see them successfully exit, to working at $bn turnover enterprises and having the rare opportunity to run Marketing through a successful Management buy-out. I champion Marketing having set-up the function from scratch at a number of organisations and am only results driven.  My broad based Marketing experience has allowed me to lead teams, including Telemarketing, and be highly skilled in all aspects of Marketing and Business Strategy, Lead Generation, Marketing Communications and Customer Referenceability – which I believe are the 4 cornerstones of the Marketing plan.  During my career Lead Generation has ruled, working very closely with Sales and Management to ensure Marketing is plugged into the strategy and delivers.   A consistent message, the right content to the right audience, referenced back to true customer advocates to drive the pipeline volume and velocity. I love understanding, building and creating the right strategy, processes and content and believe this forms the basis for Marketing success or failure.  From the right campaigns through to award nominations, collateral, websites, RFIs, sales presentations, the right Marketing copy is pivotal.  I have written Executive Summaries through to IMs (Information Memorandum) and Sales Proposals, the latter in some cases to support legacy IT projects, and feeling the excitement when a VC or client bites!","2017","Director","Blossom Tree Marketing Ltd.","https://www.linkedin.com/company/27107565","http://www.blossom-tree.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","Windsor, England, United Kingdom","Information Technology and Services","|🦆-default-invited","",

In simple terms, NRS was built on a desire for change. From hearing first hand of the poor service and experience my clients had received in the past from other competing recruitment agencies, my aim was, and still is, to be different - offering a service that is second to none and competitive too.  Since the launch of NRS back in 2013, my business portfolio has grown from strength to strength, with Nelson Group Holdings now being responsible for five leading recruitment businesses that service leading brands across the Midlands. With a reputation for excellence, NRS and its sister brands not only care to provide the highest quality service for new and existing clients across the industrial, driving and engineering sectors, but, as a strong advocate of professional development, I also make it a priority to invest in my team, providing ongoing recruitment training and support from day one.

The world’s leading CEO organisation, Vistage, approached me in 2015 to build high-impact communities of leaders across the East of England.  Six years later, the tales of personal and business growth are numerous.  (Members of these invitation-only peer-groups - all high-performing leaders - are deliberately diverse, and united by a hunger to grow as leaders, grow their teams, and grow their companies. Vistage members’ companies grow more than twice that of non-members).        My own perspective comes from leading multi-million businesses and programmes around the world, chairing international CEO forums and cross-sector consortia, founding my own company, and being non-exec director, mentor, coach, strategy consultant and personal advisor to the leaders of many other organisations - from household names to start-ups, national governments to charities.    Vistage is the most stretching, humbling and impactful environment I’ve had the privilege of being involved with.

In the late 1990s the corporate bubble had burst and in common with lots of established agents at that time, I and some colleagues thought about setting up our own business. In 1999 I took the plunge and left to co-found Oliver James, starting with two offices in Oxford and later expanding to add Kidlington, Witney and Abingdon offices. Our aim was to have a network of offices to efficiently cover the county. After many happy years, the ethos of the company changed and it became apparent that Oliver James had run its course. I began to look for a new challenge where I could have more influence. At the end of 2015 I decided to accept a directorship at JCP Estate Agents: an independent company at the higher end of the property market with two high profile offices in Oxford and high standards of customer service.  Going into 2020 the owner of the business has decided to retire and has appointed me as Managing Director, overseeing the residential sales and lettings arms of the JCP business.","2020","Managing Director","JCP Estate Agents","https://www.linkedin.com/company/11141153","http://www.jamescpenny.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","Greater Oxford Area","Real Estate","|🦆-default-invited","",

I stumbled upon a job at a sales firm, although sales wasn’t the job of my dreams I appreciated the value this type of career could give me; not only was I given the opportunity to wear a new suit but also for someone to invest time in me so I could grow and develop my potential. Having a desire to win can set you up for success anywhere. The thing I am most grateful for is being given the tools such as one of our core principles. Which is to never value money over people. Which led me on to achieving my own individual goals. I am proud of the change I have gone through and the skills I have developed. Which will allow me and my team to achieve great things.

Working in an aquarium and zoo as a teenager gave me an appreciation for the environment, nature and the delicate balance of microorganisms that need to exist to sustain healthy life. In 2011 I had an amazing opportunity to visit a famous specialist algae cultivator and professor in Asia and learn first-hand how it is produced, cultivated & the vast nutritional properties.  My personal journey to regain my health after a serious knee injury led me on this exploration.  I was determined to find a way to reduce unhealthy inflammation without having harsh side effects from common treatments. I have spent several years trialling various products working with formulators and botanical extractors.  I am excited to be able to introduce Star Fuelled so we can help as many people as possible struggling with unhealthy inflammation, live a better quality of life the natural way. We provide a botanical extract which helps enhance physical performance, binds to toxins and cleanses the detoxifying organs. Linked in with my passion for plant based health is an interest in property.  Being in a family of tradesmen and the son of an Urban Planner I’ve always been fascinated with buildings, urban planning and modern methods of construction.  I look for land, commercial or unused buildings and apply a little design TLC to be able to house families and working professionals.

Most of this experience was gained working for KPMG, the Big Four accounting firm, but I also worked for smaller firms before establishing Claritas in 2012. My Passion My passion in business is talking to clients to understand their business, its opportunities and threats and then working with them to develop a plan to achieve their commercial objectives.  These objectives are very rarely tax driven but sound tax advice plays a critical part in achieving them.  For example, there is little point in making an investment in a new project or in a new country if the post tax returns are insufficient to justify the risk taken. My Specialisms I advise on all areas of business taxation, including Corporate Tax, International Tax, M&A Tax/ Transaction Tax, R&D Tax Relief and use of the Patent Box, Management Equity and Share Options, Fiscal Valuations, Restructuring and Property issues.   Tax Compliance- Not a Commodity I also do tax compliance, with the focus on assuring you that your tax affairs are in order and that the tax effects of transactions that you have undertaken are accurately disclosed.  Too often, tax compliance is seen as a commodity product to be carried out as cheaply as possible with as much of the work and the risk as possible passed to the client.  I simply do not believe that that should be the case and I would far rather spend time talking through your compliance and the associated risks and opportunities with you than sending you a long letter full of caveats. The Businesses I Work With The clients I work with range from ambitious start ups to well established businesses with turnovers of up to £200 million.  The common thread running through all of them is a desire to grow their business and achieve their objectives.","2012","Managing Director ¦ Tax Director ¦ Corporate Tax Director","Claritas Tax Limited","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2944085","http://www.claritastax.co.uk/site/home/"," "," "," ","ClaritasTax","England, United Kingdom","Accounting","|🦆-default-invited","",

Hi, I’m David, CEO of Eviva Electrical Services, and with my expertly trained team of electricians, we transform businesses around the West Midlands to comply with legislation and a safe working environment for not just employees, but any individual that enters your premises.

In 2014 I launched a cloud-based Quality Management System called Trade Engine, which includes Customer Relationship Management and Project Management features too. Trade Engine is configurable 'on-the-fly' by the organisations that use it, meaning that when business activities change, or processes and procedures are modified, the organisation's software can quickly be re-configured to implement these by the end-user.

With extensive experience working with rental companies from several sectors including Construction, Audio Visual and events, my goal is always to find the right tools to help rental companies improve and grow. Over the years, I’ve seen the rental industry evolve and technology play an even greater part in taking hire companies to the next level, furthering their businesses with specialist software solutions.  More recently, I’ve seen an increase in the demand for paperless solutions and cloud rental software. Having worked extensively with these companies helping them take advantage of mobile apps for all areas of their business and migrating onto our cloud solution, it’s fantastic to not only be able to offer rental companies peace of mind, but also help them fulfil their goals of becoming truly paperless.

Staff motivation and happiness can be gained through encouragement, trust, and recognition, and in my role as Managing Director of Outsource International I try to apply these principles to the benefit of both the individual and the business. Outsource International depends on successful global relationships with customers and partners alike, where interpersonal skills help grow and develop these vital dependencies. I apply a lot of energy and effort in this direction, and have a proven track record to demonstrate the success of this approach.  I have been working in the IT Industry for most of my career, starting out as a Desktop / Network Engineer (MCSE), before becoming an IT Consultant and then a business owner. In 2010 my UK business moved into Outsource International to strengthen its UK operations, and I have since occupied a variety of roles within Outsource: UK Divisional Manager; Global Operations Manager; Global Transition Manager, General Manager, and more recently as Managing Director.  Our business is based on and measured by its ability to deliver successful Services. At Outsource we set very high standards day in, day out, and never let our guard down. Part of my role is to ensure we maintain these high standards through active measurement, and continue to explore what could be done better. I am always available as an Escalation Manager should the need arise.  Now for my personal, controversial opinion: whoever said ‘The customer is always right’ has clearly been misinformed. It’s simply not true. What is true however, is the customer always deserves to be dealt with in a professional, courteous and considerate manner; given all the facts, and advised of their options. Get this right, and invariably you will have a happy customer.

I believe communication is the key I work with the Homes and Communities Agency as an Independent Certifier, independent Audit Reporter and Development Strategies and Compliance Inspector. This is in conjunction with Developers where they are receiving grant direct. I am basically there to confirm to the HCA that the Developer is providing on site what they have contracted to do! I am known for my impartiality This latter role is a growing market and Developers come to me due to my experience in this role and knowledge of the requirements I have worked both sides of the fence in relation to Section 106 schemes. I have worked with Housing Associations as their Employers Agent and also worked with Developers forming an interface between them and the social Landlord. I therefore understand the special issues from both points of view. I help both sides understand the pressures that the other is under. This is no mean feat! I have been successful in putting together land and build packages with Developers and taking these to Housing Associations. This has become another 'string to my bow' Developers now come to me when they have Section 106 schemes on rural exception sites or urban sites with a requirement for social housing. I can always find the best deal not only on price but also the best Housing Association to work with. Some are easier to work with than others!

Have you contemplated selling up, but are unsure of your exit strategy?  Perhaps you’ve thought about finding an investor to help you get to the next level of turnover and you need help with the ins and outs of doing this.  As a business buyer and mergers & acquisitions specialist with eight years’ experience helping business owners ready to sell or seek investment opportunities, I can help.  I started my finance career in the late 1990s working as a consultant for various top ten London law firms. I then moved into consulting, and worked at boutique investment firm Mansford Holdings. It was during this time that I gained a deep understanding of the investment world. I discovered exciting investment strategies, and ultimately became interested in portfolio investments and acquisitions.  The M&A industry has a reputation for being notoriously unscrupulous, and I wanted to rebel against this. Consequently, Verdani Investments was born.  We are a team of unequivocally straight-talking investors who pride ourselves on our ethical approach to M&A. We align ourselves with our clients’ goals, and only buy or invest if we genuinely believe in the company’s objectives.  So how does it work?  First of all we’ll discuss your business performance and objectives and, if it aligns with us, we’ll ask for your last three years of accounts from which we make a valuation assessment.  Next, we propose a structure for purchasing or investing in your business.  The final step is the buying of or investment in the business.  We help our clients feel confident and positive about their impending exit strategy. We give them the tools to release cash from the company and, ultimately, figure out their own path to wealth.   If this sounds like something you’re interested in, just drop me a DM on LinkedIn or email me on lee@verdaniinvestments.co.uk – you can also visit my website at www.verdaniinvestments.co.uk for further info.","2019","Director","Fraycale Group"," "," ","lee@verdaniinvestments.co.uk","07976 362411"," ","supportlondon","London Area, United Kingdom","Financial Services","|🦆-default-invited|sent blog 2|sent case study","",

This has been in the capacities of Sales Director, Commercial Director and Managing Director. Since forming CMS Electracom’s UK operation in 2009, my efforts have been targeted towards the development and manufacture of electrical, cable management, data and AV solutions to the office furniture market. Having succeeded in these positions, I believe I can demonstrate broad general management experience and in depth sales and marketing knowledge. I particularly enjoy the development of innovative offers and have considerable experience in the realisation of technical sales and marketing initiatives through market interpretation. This has included the founding and the development of an SME company.   I am also well versed in ensuring the viability of business not only from the prospective of future strategic direction, but also in the aspects of matching market opportunities with resources and skill sets.    This is further supported by being fully conversant in a business to business environment.  Previous responsibilities have additionally included the identification and the development of business in International markets.  To date these have been within Central Europe, East Asia, North America and the Middle East. Inevitably, I am confident at operating at all levels and have a high degree of interpersonal ability. I remain ambitious by nature, with a considerable work rate and very much retain the desire to succeed.

Highly curious. Thirst to explore. Necessity to improve.  Firms must constantly re-evaluate their purpose, client/market needs and how they do business, in order to stay relevant and impactful.  I help Financial Services institutions radically transform. Either by helping create, implement and realise their highly complex, high risk and high profile business restructuring plans (divestments, mergers, business transfers, legal entity optimisation, subsidiary set ups, which included leading Accenture's Brexit work across Financial Services UKI). Alternatively I help firms transform digitally, with a big focus on consumer/client.  With an active interest and passion in entrepreneurship, (there’s always a better way ‘it’ can be done) I help firms innovate at all levels and maximise use of all players in this very large ecosystem across Financial Services - an interesting journey when you dare to believe and disrupt, as well as operate. A passionate speaker and coach. Advocate and sponsor for diversity and inclusion as well as next generation leadership. Multiple business award winner.

I work with startups and established businesses on their sales strategy and implementation, to help them expand their businesses, locally and across borders, and to push forward in terms of expansion of products, territories, or innovations. I do this as an advisor and mentor, or non-executive director. For example, I am on the advisory board of the Fine Art Bourse.  I advise on technical and financial business decisions and processes and I also make relevant and useful introductions and build connections across global jurisdictions on behalf of my clients. One of the things I have noticed with entrepreneurs is that it’s really lonely, especially at the startup phase (but not exclusively!). Entrepreneurs must be very versatile and agile – with a great idea, a healthy amount of optimism, a belief in their product, an open mind, and a willingness to grow. They want more than advice. They want to have a conversation or “pick a brain” with someone who won’t judge, who has experience and where there are no risks or hidden agendas. I am constantly surprised which parts people find valuable out of each conversation. Over the past few years I have performed a number of interim independent, non-executive roles at operational and board levels. I do pro-bono mentoring for post-grad students at LSE and Regents University and am involved in the entrepreneurial schools in those universities.

This can sometimes get lost in the fog that can descend when running the business day to day. Our starting point is to help you understand exactly where you are in the cycle of being a successful entrepreneur and how this might relate to things you and your family want to do in the future. Our process includes the use of sophisticated software to show you clearly how things are likely to pan out.

Or how, when people from many countries come together with a unified purpose, they can achieve the seemingly impossible, whether a $multi-million business in 50 countries or 5. The complexity is often born out of scale, technology, processes, or people, although let me not understate the enormous challenges and excitement of trying to recover or grow a business with unfulfilled potential. There is nothing more rewarding than helping people see through the complexity and find a new path to growth. I am excited about what I am now doing post-Covid by ‘productising’ my knowledge and experience, through online sales best practice auditing and business growth workshops. All still focused on helping businesses sell more by introducing sales best practice, implementing process improvement, and motivating people.  Check out some of our success stories and case studies, businesses that I am immensely proud to have been a part of you can also see what they say about me… and if you are open to sharing ideas to help your business, please do give me a call and let’s have a conversation.

This is stifling their growth potential.  Typically, they don't want to market. Thy just want clients to come and buy! When they do realise they need to market, they soon find out that they don’t have the expertise in-house or the time to build it. Most often they find this out the hard way by trying to do it themselves! Or, they’ve already tried to market their business but been let down by the marketing people and companies that they turned to for help. I see this A LOT! The problem is a lot of people think marketing is about them!  Their services. Their people. Their business history.  But you know what? No-one cares! If that stuff is relevant at all, it’s in the sales process, not marketing. Good marketing starts with focusing on the problems and opportunities that your ideal clients face.  Good marketing is about getting known, building trust, and generating leads.  Good marketing is about taking your prospects on a journey from being oblivious, to understanding that they’re afflicted, to being informed such that they know you can help.  And to do that effectively you need omni-channel marketing. You need traditional marketing and digital marketing. Heck, there's no such thing as 'digital marketing' anymore because everything is digital! At The B2B Marketer this is what we do for you. We help you to get known, build trust, and generate leads. And we do that by starting with Marketing Strategy, then we look at what the right tactics will be.

I believe that organizations that better connect with their customers can get to a place where they never lose a customer again.  &gt;In an age of personalisation and experiences, SMEs should focus on being unique. Excellent customer service is how SMEs will dominate the marketplace; customers will remember your service much longer than your price. I am a big advocate of putting the Customer First in everything you do, as repeat customers are way more profitable than new customers.   &gt;Following the era of “value for money” and “brand identity”, customers now demand personalisation and experiences. Faceless corporates are finding it harder to maintain the attention of their customers these days; an independent coffee shop can challenge the likes of Starbucks, just because of the way they make their guests “feel”. If you resonate with these thoughts, then I would love to talk to you further.

How stressful is it when: Opportunities to up-weight your promotions with additional sites and space for example floor stacks are not being looked at? Your forthcoming on pack promotion is not being talked up with store colleagues? Your displays are left in the warehouse, shredder, half empty, damaged or filled with competitor products? You don’t know what your competitors are doing in store? You don’t know which stores need greatest support due to poorest compliance levels? Our teams are in store everyday solving these problems and worries – putting it right!

We can do this for: •	Offices •	Warehouses •	Schools •	Health centres •	Any other premises where hygiene and safety are paramount  Our cameras are similar to those at Heathrow Airport identifying travellers infected with Coronavirus. We are providing these cameras nationwide. Anyone arriving at a premises fitted with the cameras are scanned by cameras designed to screen for high temperatures and signs of a fever. These include your •	Visitors •	Customers  •	Employees If anyone passing through has a high temperature or fever, the system will trigger a warning which is displayed on screen. The camera can take just a second to detect someone’s skin-surface temperature and can scan more than one person at a time, all these being achieved without any physical contact. We manage more than 500 car parks across the UK.  Clients include NHS Trusts, McDonalds and National Express. Now, following calls from former health secretary Jeremy Hunt for temperature checking to become part of daily life after lockdown, we are helping make that happen.   “Our team is trained to install and set up the cameras. Right from the date of placement of an order, we can have the cameras installed within a week – or sooner if it’s urgent.” EPS is now firmly Birmingham’s number one independent parking solutions provider.

Moreover, I am extremely results-orientated, going above and beyond to ensure KPI’s are met and understanding that KPI’s and analysis are essential in marketing. Marketing is now more than ever, a must-have for any established business to build or continue their success. The emphasis and requirement for penetrative, high-quality marketing is paramount in creating a world-leading brand identity. The importance is appreciably more than lead generation and revenue feasting, it’s an effective way of engaging customers and building relationships with customers and other businesses. It allows your company to create a more humane, approachable aspect that can separate any company from the rest. I’ve had experience with all social media platforms. I also own a strong commercial understanding of management reporting and experience in preparing and presenting reports, analysing paid social media analytics such as Pay Per Click, Cost Per Click, Click Through Rate campaigns. Therefore, creating reports on my findings and determining whether the ROI is successful enough comes naturally. I possess vast knowledge and experience in digital marketing across numerous channels (Google Ads, SEO, paid social, content marketing, email marketing etc.) Including technical experience in digital marketing practices such as SEO, conversion optimisation/ROI, PPC, and SM content creation. Furthermore, I worked with CMS to create a user-friendly, engaging website for potential customers. I am an enthusiastic team player with a strong work ethic. I understand the importance of teamwork however, I also value individual effort and single-mindedness when the occasion demands. My communicative skills, both written and verbal are extremely well-versed. I can express myself articulately and can diplomatically put forward views and agendas. I’m young and diverse and have been exposed to a plethora of different personalities through school, work and my personal life so it’s safe to say I’ve embraced every walk of life.  Moreover, my thirst, borderline obsession is for new knowledge and to continue to learn and grow in understanding different concepts and ideas in today’s world. I always want to be one step ahead of anyone else when it concerns technology, sport, politics, current affairs, food, you name it.","2021","Regional Marketing Manager","RE/MAX England & Wales","https://www.linkedin.com/company/71265113","http://www.remax.uk","shaun_mall@hotmail.co.uk"," "," "," ","West Midlands, England, United Kingdom","Real Estate","|🦆-default-invited|sent case study","",

I'm on a mission to allow busy business owners to spend time away from their office doing what they want to do. I'm privileged to work with companies across the UK to deliver admin support in the form of Data Entry, Minute Taking, Invoice and Quote management and much much more.  Increasing Profits ► Managing Directors of national businesses come to me to help them spend more time with clients and on fee-earning activities. Some are concerned that they spend too much time doing admin tasks and not on things that will help them increase their profits. Others fear that they are trying to keep too many plates spinning and it's impacting on their customer service. The rest are trying to take their business to the next level and worry that they are spending too much time in their business, not on it. Sound familiar? We're not the right fit for everyone, but if this resonates, let's talk: https://calendly.com/timeassist/consultation Family Time ► When do business owners tend to do their admin? Every time I've asked, it's 'in the evening', or 'first thing in the morning when I wake up'. Successful business owners deserve the right to spend time with loved ones when they get home. They deserve to take the kids to school. They deserve to put their feet up and watch some films. This outsourced Admin Department takes tasks that stop business owners doing what they deserve to and helps them achieve a work-life balance that they can sustain. There may be better fits for you though, but let's talk and find out: https://calendly.com/timeassist/consultation Our Values ► We believe that everything we do with you needs to be based on trust, honesty, and transparency. That's why we're the only Virtual Assistants who put both our prices and our guidelines on our website. So business owners can quickly see if it's an investment they wish to make. This is done to save them time by stopping a conversation with someone whom they know they can't work with. Let's Talk  ► message me or email info@timeassist.co.uk Specialities  ► Executive Virtual Assistant, Administration, Minute Taking, Credit Control, Invoicing, Quote Management, Diary Management, CRM Management, Social Media Management, Project Management, Event Management, Data Entry, Inbox Management.

It all began before I was two when they built me a new kind of powerchair to give me the same level of mobility as other children at that stage: to free me first to be a toddler, so that each developmental step was right there ahead to seize throughout my childhood. They succeeded. I was 'The Wheelchair Toddler'. I am now passionate about making sure that that is still available to every disabled child born now. No patronising compromise. I meet parents who, like my own parents way back when, are not ready to give up their dreams and ambitions for their child just yet. Dragonmobility's vision is to see every disabled person fully integrated in the mainstream world in a practical way.  I don't think there's any experience I've had in my education and career that I don't call upon in my current work. I use my law degree and my corporate finance experience as much as I use my child development GCSE! Running an engineering workshop is much like my theatre production days - it's about bringing everything together behind the scenes to create exquisite moments of joy. We are a not-for-profit which competes with large international corporations; we know every child by name and build them a machine that fits with their (often quite tricky) body, and we provide the expertise of over 30 years to their parents to make that work and keep it working as they grow. We are looking to the child's future: not a medicalised future, but a life and a career and a family and all the things those parents always dreamed of. We need the support of the people who also believe in children's futures.

Im Kes and i have been in the design industry for 20 + years. I'm more of a creative than a writer, hence why i hate writing these summaries. I started my own company back in 2014 so that i could create with no limits, as i can tend to think out of the box and i always got 'we can't do that its not possible with what we have@. For me that was too stifling and the words my step father would creep into my head were getting louder and louder. Yep there is no such thing as a problem, only multiple solutions if you work hard enough. So i said stuff this for a game of soldiers and created iCreative, design, print and web solutions. Oops can't you tell i love my phone. So introducing my solution to my problem: Icreative design, print and software solutions Limited is made up of four brands, iCreative, Graphic Force, iPrint GB and The Software Factory. Each team works together to provide a one stop shop for all your marketing, graphics, print and software needs. We created each team so that the could specialise in their own fields and come together when needed to help our clients shine. So that's what i created and yes as many would say i can be a bit nutty, but if it gets great solution i don't mind. Feel free to add me and i will try and make your marketing problems, turn into solutions. Wow we just had a big change, yep we changed the company name. We do the same thing, but added a bit more.

In the early 2000s, I've first started working on Ozone and UV Technologies and environmental systems when I was a student at the University. I was studying Business Administration back then but the Ozone Technology grew in me. I've done a lot of reading, research, experiment on Ozone Technologies and I still do.  Ozone and UV technologies were only used for water treatment in Turkey at the time but I was nearly obsessed with air pollution. So we started to manufacture our small scale ozone generators for kitchen exhaust systems. After a couple of successful installations for major hotels and restaurants, we jumped into industrial odour removal and started to manufacture larger scale ozone generators. By the way, we were Turkey distributors of major ozone and UV companies.  Ok, we've solved odour problems but what about smoke? One thing led to another, we found ourselves in manufacturing Electrostatic Precipitators. And after some prototypes, we've finally managed to manufacture a great product. Now after 15+ years in Turkish, Middleeast and Former Russian Countries market, I brought our business to the United Kingdom. My office is based in Birmingham but we still manufacture our products in Turkey to keep the costs lower.

HOW WE DO IT: Everyone has hard-to-sell slow moving stock for which the sales department has lost the will to market & sell. Sometimes these goods are massively discounted (even below cost) just to resolve 'the problem'. However, you should consider another option: contracting an outsourced sales company just for these products. You have no costs involved as you pay only after the sale has been done. Our buyer portfolio has over 67,500  qualified buyers from all over the world. We already handle a portfolio of 35 vendors on behalf of whom we promote & sell millions of £ worth of stock. Our vendors highly appreciate our services and leave us handling the hassle of sales while they focus on their core business. We became part of their team and they consult us on strategic decisions. Everyone works from wherever they are in the world. We hire people regardless of where they are. OUR STORY: I founded ARLL in 2011 after I was looking for an outsourced sales service company and I couldn't find it.  We now have folks in just over 30 countries. This has been amazing for the company in that we can attract and retain the best talent without them having to be in UK. So far this model has worked extraordinarily well, and we plan to continue it Our sales agents speak multiple languages – so there is a high chance to get someone speaking your language –and assist you during the sales process – without the risk of being lost in translation. Spoken languages: English, French, German, Italian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Spanish TRUE FACTS ABOUT ME: I am a Romanian business woman in a business where 99% of the companies are managed by men and many of them have have misconceptions about my nationality. So this makes me twice more motivated to succeed!","2011","Managing Director","ARLL Group of Companies","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2439016","http://www.arll.eu/","gina@arll.co.uk","00447891184131","arll.gina","ARLLtd","West Midlands, England, United Kingdom","Consumer Goods","|🦆-default-invited|sent case study","",

He is known internationally for Bus Rapid Transit development having led studies in Lagos, Accra, Kampala, Cebu, Johannesburg, Manila and Ho Chi MInh City. This has included a key role in the implementation of Africa’s first BRT in Lagos. His approach is based on the recognition that transport choice is part of lifestyle choice, transport must be considered holistically and that the answer often lies outside of traditional transport thinking, but most importantly, that transport must be focussed on user needs. He has extensive experience of the management of major projects that have developed policy and identified practical solutions to complex problems both in the UK and overseas. Specialising in public transport and the integration of land use and transport strategy, Colin has provided transport input to many regeneration, land use and master planning projects working alongside planners, architects and economists from scheme conception.

Standing on the summit of Everest was the pinnacle of my life’s dreams, but it’s just the beginning. I want to share my experience working with international teams in extreme survival situations, to inspire others to push their limits and achieve their own goals. I run motivational seminars with companies around the UK sharing my experience and expertise in health, nutrition, team management and performing in high-pressured situations. I am also founder and director of Fitways Adventures, a training and expedition company running trips in the UK and around the globe; including the Himalayas, the Amazon Rainforest, The Andes and Africa. Our main focus is running corporate team building adventures tailored specially to our client’s requirements, offering meaningful, high quality team building experiences that make a real impact on how teams function and relate. Prior to launching Fitways Adventures in 2011, I enjoyed a highly successful career in IT sales, ultimately working as an international account director for Hewlett Packard. However, having spent many years trying to juggle my demanding career with my outdoor pursuits, I finally decided to follow my true life calling and launch Fitways. When I’m not busy running seminars or leading groups up Kilimanjaro, I love to learn new skills and pursue my own adventure goals, including: •	Completing the Seven Summits •	3 Ironman Finishes •	Running the Marathon Des Sables in the Sahara  – planned for 2019 •	Completing the Yukon 1000 Kayak race – planned for 2019 •	Qualified Climbing and Mountaineering Instructor •	Level 3 Personal trainer •	Diploma in Sports Nutrition •	Diploma in Sports Massage","2013","Managing Director","Fitways Adventures","https://www.linkedin.com/company/5510459","http://fitwaysadventures.co.uk","nickhollis@fitwaysadventures.co.uk","07591076066"," ","nickatfitways","Maidenhead, England, United Kingdom","Leisure, Travel & Tourism","|🦆-default-invited|sent case study","",

The aim of Utility Aid is to ensure a high level of service and ethically conduct business with the organizations we work with. Utility Aid has been successful in all of these areas. We are now grouping the sector along with commercial companies to purchase on the wholesale markets which is the way forward. As the Commercial Director responsible for development of existing affinity partnerships and seeking new business relationships with like-minded socially aware organizations wishing to reduce energy consumption and managing consumption in an environmentally responsible and cost effective way. No frills just skills. As we head towards a supply crisis with raw materials running low and gas controlled by other entities we must make sure that we have both short and long term strategy which will enable us to sustain our operations and continue to look after those people who are not as fortunate as ourselves. This is my vision and these are my aims. I would love to debate and communicate with all parties who care about sustainable energy and reducing core costs. We have a unique way of reducing energy consumption which is employing disabled people who work from home to study consumption data. IT WORKS. Would like to encourage Social Enterprises to take up the challenge by Utility Aid training them to get their local business and charity communities to buy into a group energy basket and use the profits in the same community.....interesting and workable.

I'm currently Global Marketing Manager for Black Insomnia Coffee Company - Where I do everything from PPC Advertising to Marketing Consultancy, Global Brand Building and Social Media Management. Being pragmatic, quick-thinking and dynamic to achieve the optimum outcome, whatever the task. That's always my goal. I’m a person who would feel embarrassed to post something online that I’m not proud of. Taking pride in what I share is something that’s really important to me. Rightly or wrongly, I think everyone with a social media account becomes a brand. Some more overtly than others, but undoubtedly, it seems sharing yourself online is inseparable from self-branding. This is why it’s so crucial for brands and companies to understand and approach Marketing with compassion and understanding for their viewers. Whether it be a vlogger, short-filmmaker or an Artist sharing their work - considering the viewer should be at the heart of the content. I have been video editing since I was 13-years old. It's always been a passion of mine, and as I’ve grown older and gained some experience in Digital Marketing, I’ve recognized that my fascination with the way people behave online paired with my passion for creating has meant a symbiosis of the two in the form of Digital Marketing. Making beautiful, honest and exciting content is what drives me. I have grown up with social media, and believe I have a unique perspective with its operations. This, and my deep understanding of video and photo creation are why I believe I thrive in the Digital space. As a Fine Artist, aesthetics with the function of emotional connection is something I have a deep and thorough understanding of. I have had experience at one of the UK’s largest Digital Marketing agencies, AmazeRealise, and a 1 month paid placement at Modern Art Oxford’s Marketing department.","2020","Global Marketing Manager","Black Insomnia Coffee Company","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10844485","http://blackinsomnia.coffee","jamesglester98@gmail.com","07483456361"," "," ","Greater Oxford Area","Food & Beverages","|🦆-default-invited|sent case study","",
