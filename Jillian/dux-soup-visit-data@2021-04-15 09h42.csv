I strive to foster relationships of trust and openness, enabling clients to challenge orthodoxies, re-evaluate skill sets and make clear sighted decisions in a non-judgemental, collaborative and confidential environment. We all face a range of career challenges: • Are you embarking on a major career transition and if so, are you equipped to take on the next career move? • Is Leadership an easy fit or are some of the challenges daunting? • Do you instinctively know in your heart that you are not in the right job? • Are you unable to envision the future because work has become all consuming? • Is the career you are in, tailored to your talents and aptitudes? • Are you able to use the breath of your experience in your job? • Is your career lacking in purpose, are you unmotivated and feel stuck in a rut? • In the workplace are you facing stress, bullying or the possibility of redundancy? As a career transition coach, I can help bring fresh insight to these seemingly insoluble dilemmas, opening new career pathways and crystallising ambition into tangible goals.

Do you have conflicting thoughts and worries about the changes ahead and you need help to work through that indecision, overcome mental blocks and obstacles to clear your path to clarity, direction and positivity? I know how challenging these changes can be - sometimes feeling lost, not knowing what you want or how you are going to make it happen; mum-guilt and wobbling confidence, so your self-belief may need a boost.  I have travelled the road of reinvention too. I had an 8 year career break to care for young children, experienced two redundancies and left a profession because it no longer aligned with my values and priorities.  I didn’t make these changes alone and you don’t have to either.  This is why I am passionate about my job, I help career-breakers, and those seeking change, to re-kindle their confidence, find clarity and purpose and achieve their goals.  I will be your cheerleader and coach , supporting and challenging you;  transforming you to a future that fires you up with enthusiasm. I am a certified Learning & Skills Coach, Master Life Coach and Licensed NLP Practitioner. My NLP training is certified by the Society of NLP co-creator Dr. Richard Bandler and I was trained by one of his international team at ‘NLP Liverpool’. These NLP skills are used by the global gurus of life coaching, Tony Robins and Paul McKenna, in their transformational programmes.  I have a fascination for how our minds work to either limit or expand us. Together with my training as a biologist, adult education teacher and coach, this has given me the passion and skills to help people learn and grow. That is what lights me up on my journey with you.  I have created two coaching programmes with you in mind.  They include weekly 1-2-1 coaching, mentoring and accountability to get there.  We will explore your dreams, reignite your confidence and self-belief using coaching techniques and neurolinguistic programming (NLP) tools. You can build a powerful mindset, focus on a plan to achieve your goals and take actions which propel you towards your own vision of success.

Or are you returning to teaching and lack confidence? Perhaps you are leaving teaching and are uncertain about the way forward. Whatever stage to your career as a teacher, my coaching services are designed to empower you to make successful career changes. Simply put, helping teachers to flourish is my passion. By integrating my experience and expertise of teaching, leadership and coaching, I have developed coaching programmes to support teachers to confidently transition into new roles or to develop their unique leadership style. There are clear steps that anyone can follow to develop the mindset needed to thrive. Through the coaching process, we would work together to + Increase confidence in your skills and abilities. + Develop habits that improve sleep and increase energy.  + Create strategies to manage change and avoid burnout. You will  + Gain clarity about how to prioritise activities. + Be empowered to set boundaries and to say no to unwanted demands on your time. + Become confident in your ability to lead other people (even people who don’t want to be led.) Being a teacher, leader, mentor and coach for over thirty years has given me insight into how demanding career changes can be and the pitfalls that lead to burnout. Whether the transition is returning to school after a career break; taking on your first leadership position, becoming a senior leader or leaving teaching for new endeavours, stress, anxiety and lack of confidence can leave you feeling overwhelmed.

After travelling the country, I was then able to guide and advise others through their journey and established I was a great listener.

But you won’t just plan it, I’ll help you drive forward the changes so you can take real actions to see real results.  You’ll go from feeling anxious and overwhelmed, fearful of making any decisions in case they’re the wrong ones, to having a clear direction and road map to success.  Because if not now, then when? So, who exactly do I help?  The four key people/areas I help are: 1)	Careers Advisers and school careers leads - training and providing quality assurance processes for advice companies, ensuring a strong and trusted talent pool. 2)	Emerging talent - supporting young people in schools planning their future careers and school leavers and graduates starting out in theirs, to successfully navigate the job market and develop skills to thrive in the workplace. 3)	People in career crisis - whether you’re feeling stuck in your current career, wanting to move up or out, or if you’re facing redundancy (and assisting organisations looking for outplacement services).  Evaluating the options, designing a plan and securing that new career, through guidance, CV writing and interview tips. 4)	Supporting organisations to turn possible hires into good ones through a Talent Transformation programme and coaching and training new and aspiring managers, as well as other so called 'soft' skill development through training and/or coaching. The support interventions typically are a mixture of guidance sessions or career coaching (one to one) or group training.  If you look at my website www.thetalentcycle.co.uk you’ll find out much more on what I do, including the very simple approach to the investment, with no hidden extra costs. You’ll also find more on my qualifications, professional memberships and accolades such as being used as an example of best practice by the NfER, not to mention some great testimonials from some of my brilliant clients.  And as much as it’s not about me, it’s about you, that does mean you’ll want to know why I’m doing this and what I stand for.  My values are Authenticity, Helpfulness, Self-respect and Freedom. My super strengths are being a Helper, Creative and Driven.  DM or email me at askthetalentcycle@outlook.com to find out how I can help you drive forward the change you desire.

Leaders ensure that pupils are supported to move into post-16 education or training.” A Level-6 qualified, careers lead, looking to establish working partnerships with local/national businesses and organisations to deliver a varied, inspirational careers programme for students aged 11-18 years.  Opportunities exist for businesses and organisations to support me in delivering careers within English, mathematics, science and PSHE; each year group has their own careers day which allows students to explore a wide variety of aspirational job roles, especially STEM related job roles.  Particularly interested in interactive opportunities. I'm a manager, who enjoys facilitating the development of the people I work with.  A good eye for detail enables me to plan effectively and makes tasks such as policy and working document development, alongside of auditing and quality monitoring easy tasks for me to undertake.  I'm also a qualified careers adviser and working with people to ensure that they have the motivation, confidence, skills and knowledge to take-up training, education and employment opportunities provides me with immense work satisfaction.   I'm creative, having developed many resources which aid the efficiency of staff and support clients.  For example, in 2013, I co-chaired a working party on supporting clients to develop their own CVs. This led to me write an approximate 7,500 word adviser guide, entitled; Empowering Clients To Write Their Own CVs. The guide was issued to all National Careers Advisers in the South East of England and was well received.  I have written and delivered workshops focussing on employment skills and knowledge.  I enjoy responsibility and have a strong focus on solutions, not problems.","2020","Careers and Associate Development Manager","Griffin School Trust"," "," ","karen.malone@stantonbury.org.uk"," "," "," ","Milton Keynes, England, United Kingdom","Education Management","|🦆-default-invited|sent ebook","",

I am a positive psychologist, coach and career counsellor  involved in exploring my client's personal and professional potential. My adventure with psychology began in 2014, when I graduated from Health and Social Sciences and started studying Psychology at Westminster University in London. A few years later, I completed my master's thesis in the field of Applied Positive Psychology and Psychology of Coaching. The service I offer combines theoretical knowledge from the best sources with practical tools in the field of health prevention, career management, psychological support and professional coaching and mentoring. I adopt a holistic approach, allowing you to carry out real changes to improve your personal and professional life. As a goal and opportunity oriented practitioner, I can support you with  achieving a deeper self-understanding, exploring your their strengths and personal potential, finding their answers and creating an inspiring future, while building confidence, resources and an internal compass.   A key element of my psychological, coaching and counselling practice is action-based conversation. As I support the growth of human potential, I am convinced that personal fulfilment and gaining satisfaction in life comes from a mature understanding of yourself, your possibilities and your life purpose.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to invite you on a positive psychological journey towards self-understanding and self-fulfillment; in a confidential, enthusiastic, stimulating and non-judgmental space. ​ Working on a project and think we could collaborate ?

If you’re searching for an inspirational careers adviser and leader , please read on. I’m an independent consultant and Registered Career Development Professional with over 25 years’ successful and varied experience as a Careers practitioner.  I’ve had extensive experience as a careers guidance practitioner and leader in a variety of roles in the UK and overseas. I started freelancing in March 2020 after 20 years at Lincoln College, where I led a guidance team that established a wide reputation for innovation and consistently high levels of student satisfaction. Prior to that I also worked in Europe. My specialty is the provision of individual guidance to both adult career changers and young people on all the options that are open to them when changing jobs/careers or leaving school ,college or university. These options include higher education in the UK or overseas, apprenticeships, employment, self-employment, gap years. I also speak and advise on topics surrounding university applications, UCAS personal statements and the skills that people now need for their future careers in a radically-changing world, and can offer application mentoring helping students to explore choices and produce a focused personal statement to catch the eye of admission tutors. For those students facing barriers to higher education I can provide a mentoring service with guidance through each stage of the process.

Some specific equations I simulate are curve shortening flow in a parametric sense and the Allen-Cahn equation in a phase field sense. Moreover, I completed finite element analysis of these equations as part of my thesis.

I consider myself to be extremely fortunate to have worked for over 25 years in a sector I love – hospitality and leisure - where teamwork across a diverse skillset is paramount.  I initially worked in an operational role within Center Parcs, responsible for the day to day running of the first village in the UK - Sherwood Forest.  I went on to specialise in Recruitment and Training, inducting 1000 new employees every year into a variety of careers and at all levels, including Leisure, Spas, Retail, Catering and Housekeeping as well as specialists in IT, Finance, Sales & Marketing, Purchasing, HR and Technical Services. I also secured new opportunities funding to set up and run a small not for profit childcare business, employing my own team which ran very successfully for over 12 years.   As a Coach and Facilitator, I believe I offer a credible, pragmatic and practical approach which is both friendly and relaxed. I aim to quickly put clients at ease and build a strong and dependable relationship.  I am experienced in supporting clients at varying stages of transition whether considering a complete change of direction, starting up a new business venture or taking active retirement.  I have supported a wide range of clients in the areas of:  • Career Transition – providing support to enable clients to review their own personal journey and help to clarify and make plans to achieve career goals for the future  • Personal Resilience – supporting and helping clients to thrive during periods of intense personal change   • Job Searching – significant expertise in helping clients develop a tailored CV and Linked In Profile, consider all job searching routes and skills practice to prepare for interview. • New Business Start Up – providing support to develop and review a business plan, find local networking opportunities and possible funding streams as well as developing resilience in the early years • Active Retirement –  expertise in helping clients review their personal goals and the opportunities to take up new challenges as they move away from employment into a new phase of life.

Artistic & participatory research methods  I joined The University of Manchester in a research position in 2013, when I was awarded a PhD studentship.  In September 2018 I  was awarded a 3 year Early Career Research Fellowship by the Leverhulme Trust. I am currently conducting a 3 year international comparative research project funded by the Trust - Redefining Education for an Urban Social Solidarity Economy: Becoming Relational. The project Redefining Education for an Urban Social Solidarity Economy: Becoming Relational considers how more relational approaches to policy, governance, curriculum & pedagogy impact on relationships, not only between institutions & their stakeholders but can positively impact more widely on democracy & social justice in urban places.  The research explores how urban policymakers & academics are conceptualising and/or operationalising the links between a social solidarity urban economy & the development of education policy/ governance/curriculum or pedagogy.  I compare the views of professionals with the lived experiences of children, young people and their communities. Using visual & artistic methods & participatory mapping techniques, children and young people create participant artefacts that foreground their opinions, feelings & experiences.  The approach is an attempt to better understand the lived realities of children and young people’s urban education experiences and the extent to which they feel that there has been an attempt to make their city/urban neighbourhood more inclusive and equitable through its education polices and practices.   Before beginning my research career, I worked as a teacher and teacher educator in both Further and Higher Education for twenty years, managing, developing and teaching on Literacy, ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) and Postgraduate Certificate in Education programmes and as the centre coordinator for an inner-city alternative education provision for 13-19-year-olds.","2018","Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow ","The University of Manchester","https://www.linkedin.com/company/166652","http://www.manchester.ac.uk/"," "," "," "," ","United Kingdom","Higher Education","|🦆-default-invited","",

In Dundee and Clydebank I helped to establish and develop partnerships between employers, schools, colleges and universities.  After being appointed as an Education Guidance Adviser at the University of Paisley, I advised full-time and part-time students on programmes of study that could enhance their career prospects.  My work also included organising for University modules to be taught on employers' premises and advising on academic credit awarded for prior learning. I was responsible for co-ordinating the development of a part-time day prospectus and of a CD-ROM for use by employers in staff development programmes. After having a family, I kept my guidance skills up to date through my mentoring role with Prince's Trust Youth Business Scotland supporting young people who were hoping to set up their own business.  I was also a Regional Ambassador for the Forth Valley branch and felt very honoured when named as Volunteer of the Year in 2012. I was given the opportunity to further support young people in an educational setting when recruited as a reader/scribe by Perth College UHI in 2013 working both in the classroom and in assessment settings. In 2017, I was appointed by Discover Dunblane BID as an Employability Engagement Facilitator to support pupils in the senior phase at Dunblane High School. My role was to support the pupils to identify opportunities with local businesses and third sector organisations who could assist them with increasing their life, employment and employability skills. In 2019, I was appointed to the Careers and Employability Service at Perth College UHI as a Careers Adviser and have responsibility to offer careers guidance, advice and information to prospective, current and former students. The work also includes a range of employability services on a one to one basis as well as through workshops which cover the compilation of CVs, cover letters, personal statements for the full range of further and higher education courses, job applications and interviews, job search and resilience.

Successfully co-ordinated The National Careers Service (formerly Next Step) contract and the provision of Information, Advice and Guidance (IAG) across various other contracts at Options Training, winning an Achievement Award at the Next Step East Midlands Annual Conference in 2011. Showing imagination and forward-thinking, I took the initiative to ensure funding targets were increased at Learn IT and Options Training. I then focussed on achieving these targets, bringing in significant extra income due to my conscientious approach and determination. Single-handedly ran the Criminal Department at Thompson Leatherdale for 6 years and secured a Legal Aid Franchise for the firm whilst maintaining a large caseload. Promoted to Partner due to my hard work, dedication and positive contribution to the firm. Fulfilled a life time’s ambition to travel the world, rising to the challenge of planning and organising a trip round the world and experiencing different cultures along the way. Demonstrating my commitment, drive and resolve, I have successfully completed 10 London Marathons in a row, raising over £24000 for Parkinson’s UK and Headway. I also participated in a 130 km Trek across the Namib Desert in Namibia for Parkinson’s UK, a fantastic experience.

Though I was in private practice in Manchester, Lincolnshire, Cheshire and Sussex, I found my niche in the CPS and prosecuting. There I enjoyed a mix of experience including management of team/office, advocacy in MC and CC, delivering training in law updates and Youth Court specialism, amongst a range of activities. I managed &gt; 23 years of enjoyable and fulfilling work before I took redundancy and early retirement for pastures new.  Now I am CELTA qualified to teach English as a foreign language and have been working at TWiN School of English in Eastbourne since June 2012, which has opened up some private tuition and then teaching at a Russian language school near Moscow at Easter in 2013 and again in 2018. In addition I have worked online in research and editing material re various countries' VAT/Sales Tax systems as a Project for a tax and business information company, Wolters Kluwers. This has enabled Lena and me also to devote most of October and all of November for the last twelve years to helping a Christian charity Hope Now promote its work with widows and orphans in Ukraine by a month long concert tour of churches and schools. 2018 was a gap year but 2019 was a shorter tour (particularly for Lena) to regain momentum after the break. Do have a look at the charity’s website to get a taster: www.hopenow.org.uk. 2018 saw me venture into the educational world by delivering a CILex course on Criminal Law and a Marketing Course in a Business Foundation Degree at Sussex Downs College (now East Sussex College). I continued the latter last academic year with Business Law - am glad to say all passed and some enabled to continue to formal degree at Brighton Uni Business School. This year ILEX was offered again but ended up not going ahead. With CVid and everything else, we await developments. Meanwhile TWiN School took over LTC and the Duke of Devonshire’s Manor House, only to close in March due to Covid and furlough its teachers. 😔","2021","Employment Consultant","Twin Group","https://www.linkedin.com/company/860324","http://www.twinuk.com"," "," "," "," ","Eastbourne, England, United Kingdom","Education Management","|🦆-default-invited","",

Are you procrastinating and feeling overwhelmed?  Do you feel confused about how to tame your thesis/dissertation so you can actually write what you want to say? Would you like to:  •	Get passed that bottleneck in your thinking? •	Be motivated to tackle your thesis and not let it get the better of you? •	Be held accountable for minor goals, not just whole chapters? •	Avoid the PhD summer slump when your supervisor is not around? •	Make sure your thesis is something you are proud of, showcasing you at your best? •	Let the magic of a small, friendly group encourage you to sit at your computer and engage head-on, rather than procrastinate? I get it. I experienced all of this and more and overcame these issues. I completed my PhD, despite exhaustion, procrastination (ever read a book about procrastination in order to procrastinate?) and imposter syndrome. Furthermore, I said what I wanted to say in the PhD, said it clearly and I am very proud of it. None of this ‘good enough’ thesis to haunt you forever.  I know exactly what you need to get through this, and to get through it triumphantly, all dancing, all singing, happy with the outcome, proud of yourself, knowing you said everything you wanted to say. You want to finish your PhD in style, not in pain.  I distilled what I found worked into Study Hubs. I am Dr Natalie Lancer, The Uni Coach. I am a graduate of Oxford, King’s College, London, The Open University and Birkbeck, University of London. I have been coaching students since 2010 and currently supervise Master’s and PhD students at the New School of Counselling and Psychotherapy. I convene regular Study Hubs which are basically online writing retreats – with a difference. We meet online the day before the retreat to make sure you have everything to hand for the following day. On the day itself, we kick off with creativity, motivational and goal-setting exercises grounded in your work, and then remain on line for short writing blocks. We have (lots of) tea/coffee and lunch together. Each person gets coached by me in a separate zoom room during the day to blast through that thing that is bothering you, so you will be turbo-charged to confidently write that section that has eluded you for months.  If you are interested in having a chat with me about how I can help you, please send me a message.","2020","Thesis/dissertation coach","The Uni Coach "," "," ","natalie.lancer@gmail.com","07747 612 513"," "," ","United Kingdom","Higher Education","|🦆-default-invited|sent ebook","",
