I do this by understanding three things about your business: ● Strategy - I look at what your business is trying to achieve in the short and medium term (irrespective of IT), before understanding how your IT strategy and roadmap fits with that vision. ● IT and OT - I look at your existing IT and OT landscapes (your 'As-Is'), clarify the technological capabilities that exist in both those domains and highlight where you have potential gaps.  I then help you prepare for the future with a clear plan and roadmap based on current risks as well as opportunities for enhancement, efficiency, and growth (your 'To-Be'). ► SMEs I help SMEs who create products for these sectors to get a better view on how to integrate their products into large corporate ('enterprise') IT environments. Enterprise IT can be very complex, with numerous technology standards and information management/security policies which often do not manifest elsewhere.  Many manufacturing / energy products are built with highly specialised functions in mind, not adherence to a plethora of IT guidelines which can vary from client to client.

It is now the latter part of 2021, and we have come some distance from those days. We closed our very first year with revenues of c. £2 Million, and are now trending towards almost 4X that figure in this financial year. We must be doing something right to see this kind of client community support.   We started off this journey trying to reimagine how the Tech Recruiting and Services business works (or not!) in the UK. As Founders with deep and long experience in the UK market for over 20+ years, we decided to offer something different. Our initial focus was (and still is) on servicing the substantive demand for digital front end work – the Full Stack development segment supported by capability on Cloud, Data and Cyber Security. Hence the Firm’s name signalling a boutique orientation, with StackStudio Digital. As we added a number of clients in our Year 1, we began hearing about the support they needed on the broader CRM and CX needs – how to embrace CX/CRM the right way, and the quintessential question of whether to do this with a market-leading platform or just do best-of-breed solutions.  This focus – on Digital Enabling our clients’ CX/CRM needs – is going to be our raison d'etre for the future!  Today, we run a fairly global operation – our team of Researchers, Recruiters and Key Account Managers are based in India and Philippines, while our Cloud, Cyber and Data Consultants and Architects, Salesforce Experts and Sales team are based in the UK.

Have you contemplated selling up, but are unsure of your exit strategy?  Perhaps you’ve thought about finding an investor to help you get to the next level of turnover and you need help with the ins and outs of doing this.  As a business buyer and mergers & acquisitions specialist with eight years’ experience helping business owners ready to sell or seek investment opportunities, I can help.  I started my finance career in the late 1990s working as a consultant for various top ten London law firms. I then moved into consulting, and worked at boutique investment firm Mansford Holdings. It was during this time that I gained a deep understanding of the investment world. I discovered exciting investment strategies, and ultimately became interested in portfolio investments and acquisitions.  The M&A industry has a reputation for being notoriously unscrupulous, and I wanted to rebel against this. Consequently, Verdani Investments was born.  We are a team of unequivocally straight-talking investors who pride ourselves on our ethical approach to M&A. We align ourselves with our clients’ goals, and only buy or invest if we genuinely believe in the company’s objectives.  So how does it work?  First of all we’ll discuss your business performance and objectives and, if it aligns with us, we’ll ask for your last three years of accounts from which we make a valuation assessment.  Next, we propose a structure for purchasing or investing in your business.  The final step is the buying of or investment in the business.  We help our clients feel confident and positive about their impending exit strategy. We give them the tools to release cash from the company and, ultimately, figure out their own path to wealth.   If this sounds like something you’re interested in, just drop me a DM on LinkedIn or email me on lee@verdaniinvestments.co.uk – you can also visit my website at www.verdaniinvestments.co.uk for further info.",2019,Director,Fraycale Group, , ,lee@verdaniinvestments.co.uk,07976 362411, ,supportlondon,"London Area, United Kingdom",Financial Services,|Sent brand refresh blog|sent blog 2|sent case study|sent pitch|🦆-default-followup-1|🦆-default-invited,,

My company can bring you cameras that spot signs of Covid-19 to make sure you are warned.  We can do this for: •	Offices •	Warehouses •	Schools •	Health centres •	Any other premises where hygiene and safety are paramount  Our cameras are similar to those at Heathrow Airport identifying travellers infected with Coronavirus. We are providing these cameras nationwide. Anyone arriving at a premises fitted with the cameras are scanned by cameras designed to screen for high temperatures and signs of a fever. These include your •	Visitors •	Customers  •	Employees If anyone passing through has a high temperature or fever, the system will trigger a warning which is displayed on screen. The camera can take just a second to detect someone’s skin-surface temperature and can scan more than one person at a time, all these being achieved without any physical contact. We manage more than 500 car parks across the UK.  Clients include NHS Trusts, McDonalds and National Express. Now, following calls from former health secretary Jeremy Hunt for temperature checking to become part of daily life after lockdown, we are helping make that happen.   “Our team is trained to install and set up the cameras.

It all began before I was two when they built me a new kind of powerchair to give me the same level of mobility as other children at that stage: to free me first to be a toddler, so that each developmental step was right there ahead to seize throughout my childhood. They succeeded. I was 'The Wheelchair Toddler'. I am now passionate about making sure that that is still available to every disabled child born now. No patronising compromise. I meet parents who, like my own parents way back when, are not ready to give up their dreams and ambitions for their child just yet. Dragonmobility's vision is to see every disabled person fully integrated in the mainstream world in a practical way.  I don't think there's any experience I've had in my education and career that I don't call upon in my current work. I use my law degree and my corporate finance experience as much as I use my child development GCSE! Running an engineering workshop is much like my theatre production days - it's about bringing everything together behind the scenes to create exquisite moments of joy. We are a not-for-profit which competes with large international corporations; we know every child by name and build them a machine that fits with their (often quite tricky) body, and we provide the expertise of over 30 years to their parents to make that work and keep it working as they grow. We are looking to the child's future: not a medicalised future, but a life and a career and a family and all the things those parents always dreamed of. We need the support of the people who also believe in children's futures.

This is stifling their growth potential.  Typically, they don't want to market. Thy just want clients to come and buy! When they do realise they need to market, they soon find out that they don’t have the expertise in-house or the time to build it. Most often they find this out the hard way by trying to do it themselves! Or, they’ve already tried to market their business but been let down by the marketing people and companies that they turned to for help. I see this A LOT! The problem is a lot of people think marketing is about them!  Their services. Their people. Their business history.  But you know what? No-one cares! If that stuff is relevant at all, it’s in the sales process, not marketing. Good marketing starts with focusing on the problems and opportunities that your ideal clients face.  Good marketing is about getting known, building trust, and generating leads.  Good marketing is about taking your prospects on a journey from being oblivious, to understanding that they’re afflicted, to being informed such that they know you can help.  And to do that effectively you need omni-channel marketing. You need traditional marketing and digital marketing. Heck, there's no such thing as 'digital marketing' anymore because everything is digital! At The B2B Marketer this is what we do for you. We help you to get known, build trust, and generate leads.

Whether you are a private investor or represent a retail or institutional client, we will guide you through every step of the process; helping you add whisky casks to your investment portfolio. http://bit.ly/whiskyinvestment-ppt Whisky may have originated in illegal stills hidden in the Scottish Highlands and coastal areas, but it’s a global passion now. This helped it rise to the top of the Knight Frank Investment Index in 2020 thanks to a remarkable 564% growth over a 10-year period and a 5% growth that year alone. http://bit.ly/Knight-Frank-Investment-Index  Cask Whisky investments have historically averaged 10%-15% returns each and every year. According to researchandmarkets.com, the global whisky market is projected to grow at 5.51% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) between 2020 to 2025. Here are just a few reasons which make Cask Whisky ownership an attractive, low-risk investment option: ●	Tangible Asset in a non-correlated sector ●	Minimum investment from £ 2,200 	 ●	Easy to use online portal for a secure purchase and overview of all available stock ●	Stored in HMRC approved, secure bonded warehouses ●	Fully insured for the duration of the investment ●	Clear exit strategies ●	CGT and VAT exempt I am happy to answer questions or explain the investment in more detail.

I believe that organizations that better connect with their customers can get to a place where they never lose a customer again.  &gt;In an age of personalisation and experiences, SMEs should focus on being unique. Excellent customer service is how SMEs will dominate the marketplace; customers will remember your service much longer than your price. I am a big advocate of putting the Customer First in everything you do, as repeat customers are way more profitable than new customers.   &gt;Following the era of “value for money” and “brand identity”, customers now demand personalisation and experiences. Faceless corporates are finding it harder to maintain the attention of their customers these days; an independent coffee shop can challenge the likes of Starbucks, just because of the way they make their guests “feel”. If you resonate with these thoughts, then I would love to talk to you further.

My passion and purpose is assisting clients evolve and disrupt their core business practices, to realise optimum benefit from software and best practice business principles. Academic Qualifications Bachelor of Science (Hons) Mech Eng, Accounting, Economics. I've collected numerous short course diplomas and certificates in a variety of complementary disciplines. I read over 35 books a year and deeply value continuous learning  Business Expertise and Specialities I've worked with 100's of companies of differing sizes and industry sectors in the United Kingdom and in South Africa. This has seen me gain valuable experience and develop industry-specific expertise in how best to structure a wide variety of business types for optimal results – both in terms of reporting from the financial systems and in helping to streamline business processes throughout the value chain. Business Mentoring and Consulting Experience Over my career, my biggest reward has been supporting others in their personal and business growth and development. My interactions have been formal consulting engagements with companies as well as informal mentoring of business owners, executives, managers and their colleagues. Working in diverse industries such as HVAC, engineering consultancies, small and large scale manufacturing, agriculture, food production and packaging, services, retail and distribution has taught me that although the landscape is different for each, the deeper business principles and underlying best practice concepts remain the same. My greatest personal rewards have come from working with start-ups as well as established businesses who have a growth mindset and want to scale up, owners/managers who evolve their current operations into new markets and improved ways of working, merger & acquisition activities and creating exit strategies and succession plans.

HOW WE DO IT: Everyone has hard-to-sell slow moving stock for which the sales department has lost the will to market & sell. Sometimes these goods are massively discounted (even below cost) just to resolve 'the problem'. However, you should consider another option: contracting an outsourced sales company just for these products. You have no costs involved as you pay only after the sale has been done. Our buyer portfolio has over 67,500  qualified buyers from all over the world. We already handle a portfolio of 35 vendors on behalf of whom we promote & sell millions of £ worth of stock. Our vendors highly appreciate our services and leave us handling the hassle of sales while they focus on their core business. We became part of their team and they consult us on strategic decisions. Everyone works from wherever they are in the world. We hire people regardless of where they are. OUR STORY: I founded ARLL in 2011 after I was looking for an outsourced sales service company and I couldn't find it.  We now have folks in just over 30 countries. This has been amazing for the company in that we can attract and retain the best talent without them having to be in UK. So far this model has worked extraordinarily well, and we plan to continue it Our sales agents speak multiple languages – so there is a high chance to get someone speaking your language –and assist you during the sales process – without the risk of being lost in translation. Spoken languages: English, French, German, Italian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Spanish TRUE FACTS ABOUT ME: I am a Romanian business woman in a business where 99% of the companies are managed by men and many of them have have misconceptions about my nationality.

I'm privileged to work with companies across the UK to deliver admin support in the form of Data Entry, Minute Taking, Invoice and Quote management and much much more.  Increasing Profits ► Managing Directors of national businesses come to me to help them spend more time with clients and on fee-earning activities. Some are concerned that they spend too much time doing admin tasks and not on things that will help them increase their profits. Others fear that they are trying to keep too many plates spinning and it's impacting on their customer service. The rest are trying to take their business to the next level and worry that they are spending too much time in their business, not on it. Sound familiar? We're not the right fit for everyone, but if this resonates, let's talk: https://calendly.com/timeassist/consultation Family Time ► When do business owners tend to do their admin? Every time I've asked, it's 'in the evening', or 'first thing in the morning when I wake up'. Successful business owners deserve the right to spend time with loved ones when they get home. They deserve to take the kids to school. They deserve to put their feet up and watch some films. This outsourced Admin Department takes tasks that stop business owners doing what they deserve to and helps them achieve a work-life balance that they can sustain.

Do digital channels drive the majority of your revenue, or could they over the next 2-3 years?  Looking to grow your revenue by up to £35m by improving your digital marketing & e-commerce performance? You know the potential is there but unsure which levers to pull to grow revenue:  - find new channels vs optimise existing channels to grow traffic and find new audiences;  - or improve onsite conversion;  - or focus on digital marketing channels for existing customers.   You need to maintain the focus on day-to-day trading performance whilst planning and investing in digital over a 1-3 year time horizon. You already have a digital marketing team but unsure which areas you should be investing in,  or whether you have the right depth and breadth of skills required and in which areas.  Or maybe you have out sourced digital marketing to agencies but don’t feel you are getting the return and value for money. Your marketing acquisition costs or cost of sale are increasing, but you don’t have the visibility on what’s driving this, or how specific channels, segments or campaigns are performing. You are frustrated by the length of time to implement digital product changes;  or you have invested in your digital IT capabilities and platforms but lack the digital product experience within your business or marketing teams and want to move towards more agile based delivery. DOES ANY OF THIS RESONATE?  If it does then you are not alone - every client I have worked with over the last 12 years had at least two of these challenges.   I would work with you, your teams and agencies to identify and solve these problems, improve your digital maturity and performance, and in doing so unlock the revenue growth opportunities.

As someone who wants to improve access to justice for all, I have a profound interest in criminal law, civil liberties, immigration, social welfare and supporting marginalised and vulnerable groups in society. I am a registered Optometrist, with a 2:1 degree from Aston University, and more than 15 years of commercial experience in building own business interests. I am now looking to transition into a legal career and am actively seeking mini-pupillages and volunteer work experience. As a result of my earlier career as a clinical practitioner and business owner, I have developed strong drafting and research abilities, as well as persuasive negotiation skills. I recently secured requisite planning permission for one of my rental properties and project manage teams of professionals on building / refurbishment works.  As a clinician, I pioneered better access to eye care and provided children from disadvantaged backgrounds the opportunity of better, improved sight.  Drawing on an entrepreneurial mindset and robust work ethic, I challenge assumptions and explore new ways to facilitate workable solutions, with a progressive viewpoint and balanced commercial judgement.  Through my work in international logistics, I grew business activities from the ground up into sustainable, profitable operations. Relationships are critical to my work and I resonate with people at all levels and in all cultures, sharing knowledge and instilling a culture of high performance with an open and collaborative approach. I care about organisations that combine innovation and social impact to further public justice, human rights and civil liberties, strengthen peace and security initiatives, and provide a voice to seldom-heard groups.

I work with startups and established businesses on their sales strategy and implementation, to help them expand their businesses, locally and across borders, and to push forward in terms of expansion of products, territories, or innovations. I do this as an advisor and mentor, or non-executive director. For example, I am on the advisory board of the Fine Art Bourse.  I advise on technical and financial business decisions and processes and I also make relevant and useful introductions and build connections across global jurisdictions on behalf of my clients. One of the things I have noticed with entrepreneurs is that it’s really lonely, especially at the startup phase (but not exclusively!). Entrepreneurs must be very versatile and agile – with a great idea, a healthy amount of optimism, a belief in their product, an open mind, and a willingness to grow. They want more than advice. They want to have a conversation or “pick a brain” with someone who won’t judge, who has experience and where there are no risks or hidden agendas. I am constantly surprised which parts people find valuable out of each conversation. Over the past few years I have performed a number of interim independent, non-executive roles at operational and board levels. I do pro-bono mentoring for post-grad students at LSE and Regents University and am involved in the entrepreneurial schools in those universities.

I am a communicator since day one.  My first challenge allowed me to connect the dots between my knowledge in Health and Marketing. I was challenged to launch Adoeci, the first platform in Portugal that gathers patients with rare diseases.  Among other professional experiences, in 2016, I started as Head of Communications in a fashion wholesaler showroom. Hot Pink is one of the biggest wholesalers representing fashion international brands in Portugal. My biggest accomplishment was to coordinate online and offline communications with an omnichannel strategy. Recently, I participated in a national entrepreneurship program. Brought an idea from the shelf and founded femptie, a marketplace for ethical and sustainable brands.  I have 7 years of experience in Digital Marketing and 4 as Digital Project Manager.  My professional life can be explained by a nonlinear line that shows off my resilient vein.  I´ve learned that dreams without concretization are not a good deal.

Constant change, uncertainty and a difficult work environment may make you feel out of control and you may be asked to do more and more with less and less.  Chronic stress leads to significant neurological strain which means our performance drops, we feel disillusioned and exhausted.

She believes that it should be possible to thrive both in work and life and that you shouldn't have to choose between working and being happy.  Rachel has created the Shapes Toolkit® to help busy professionals and their teams to beat stress and thrive at work through increasing their wellbeing, helping them take control of their time and prioritise their work and have better conversations so that they can feel calm, in control and thrive in their workplace.  The Shapes Toolkit is an interactive and experiential course and helps managers and individuals to: •	Understand the neuroscience of stress  •	Recognise signs and symptoms of stress in their teams  •	Create a good workplace •	Help teams increase their wellbeing •	Recognise and change their response to stressful events •	Manage their time and prioritise their workload •	Learn how to have coaching conversations to support behaviour change •	Empower their teams to be more proactive and take control Rachel also hosts the popular podcast You Are Not A Frog and is also Director of Leadership Courses for Red Whale (GP Update Ltd), a national Primary Care training organisation.

This has included a key role in the implementation of Africa’s first BRT in Lagos. His approach is based on the recognition that transport choice is part of lifestyle choice, transport must be considered holistically and that the answer often lies outside of traditional transport thinking, but most importantly, that transport must be focussed on user needs. He has extensive experience of the management of major projects that have developed policy and identified practical solutions to complex problems both in the UK and overseas. Specialising in public transport and the integration of land use and transport strategy, Colin has provided transport input to many regeneration, land use and master planning projects working alongside planners, architects and economists from scheme conception. His belief in high quality public transport has ensured his involvement in many land mark schemes encompassing both rail and bus based modes.   His role on the steering committee’s of a succession of European projects examining the application of quality public transport across Europe has placed him at the forefront of the application of new approaches and new technologies to meet mode share targets and provide for the needs of the user.

Moreover, I am extremely results-orientated, going above and beyond to ensure KPI’s are met and understanding that KPI’s and analysis are essential in marketing. Marketing is now more than ever, a must-have for any established business to build or continue their success. The emphasis and requirement for penetrative, high-quality marketing is paramount in creating a world-leading brand identity. The importance is appreciably more than lead generation and revenue feasting, it’s an effective way of engaging customers and building relationships with customers and other businesses. It allows your company to create a more humane, approachable aspect that can separate any company from the rest. I’ve had experience with all social media platforms. I also own a strong commercial understanding of management reporting and experience in preparing and presenting reports, analysing paid social media analytics such as Pay Per Click, Cost Per Click, Click Through Rate campaigns. Therefore, creating reports on my findings and determining whether the ROI is successful enough comes naturally. I possess vast knowledge and experience in digital marketing across numerous channels (Google Ads, SEO, paid social, content marketing, email marketing etc.) Including technical experience in digital marketing practices such as SEO, conversion optimisation/ROI, PPC, and SM content creation. Furthermore, I worked with CMS to create a user-friendly, engaging website for potential customers. I am an enthusiastic team player with a strong work ethic. I understand the importance of teamwork however, I also value individual effort and single-mindedness when the occasion demands. My communicative skills, both written and verbal are extremely well-versed. I can express myself articulately and can diplomatically put forward views and agendas. I’m young and diverse and have been exposed to a plethora of different personalities through school, work and my personal life so it’s safe to say I’ve embraced every walk of life.  Moreover, my thirst, borderline obsession is for new knowledge and to continue to learn and grow in understanding different concepts and ideas in today’s world. I always want to be one step ahead of anyone else when it concerns technology, sport, politics, current affairs, food, you name it.",2021,Regional Marketing Manager,RE/MAX England & Wales,https://www.linkedin.com/company/71265113,http://www.remax.uk,shaun_mall@hotmail.co.uk, , , ,"West Midlands, England, United Kingdom",Real Estate,|Sent brand refresh blog|sent case study|sent pitch|🦆-default-followup-1|🦆-default-invited,,

For me that was too stifling and the words my step father would creep into my head were getting louder and louder. Yep there is no such thing as a problem, only multiple solutions if you work hard enough. So i said stuff this for a game of soldiers and created iCreative, design, print and web solutions.

So introducing my solution to my problem: Icreative design, print and software solutions Limited is made up of four brands, iCreative, Graphic Force, iPrint GB and The Software Factory. Each team works together to provide a one stop shop for all your marketing, graphics, print and software needs. We created each team so that the could specialise in their own fields and come together when needed to help our clients shine. So that's what i created and yes as many would say i can be a bit nutty, but if it gets great solution i don't mind.

Standing on the summit of Everest was the pinnacle of my life’s dreams, but it’s just the beginning. I want to share my experience working with international teams in extreme survival situations, to inspire others to push their limits and achieve their own goals. I run motivational seminars with companies around the UK sharing my experience and expertise in health, nutrition, team management and performing in high-pressured situations. I am also founder and director of Fitways Adventures, a training and expedition company running trips in the UK and around the globe; including the Himalayas, the Amazon Rainforest, The Andes and Africa. Our main focus is running corporate team building adventures tailored specially to our client’s requirements, offering meaningful, high quality team building experiences that make a real impact on how teams function and relate. Prior to launching Fitways Adventures in 2011, I enjoyed a highly successful career in IT sales, ultimately working as an international account director for Hewlett Packard.

I'm currently Global Marketing Manager for Black Insomnia Coffee Company - Where I do everything from Facebook Advertising to Marketing Consultancy, Global Brand Building and Social Media Management. Being pragmatic, quick-thinking and dynamic to achieve the optimum outcome, whatever the task. That's always my goal. I’m a person who would feel embarrassed to post something online that I’m not proud of. Taking pride in what I share is something that’s really important to me. Rightly or wrongly, I think everyone with a social media account becomes a brand. Some more overtly than others, but undoubtedly, it seems sharing yourself online is inseparable from self-branding. This is why it’s so crucial for brands and companies to understand and approach Marketing with compassion and understanding for their viewers. Whether it be a vlogger, short-filmmaker or an Artist sharing their work - considering the viewer should be at the heart of the content. I have been video editing since I was 13-years old. It's always been a passion of mine, and as I’ve grown older and gained some experience in Digital Marketing, I’ve recognized that my fascination with the way people behave online paired with my passion for creating has meant a symbiosis of the two in the form of Digital Marketing. Making beautiful, honest and exciting content is what drives me. I have grown up with social media, and believe I have a unique perspective with its operations. This, and my deep understanding of video and photo creation are why I believe I thrive in the Digital space. As a Fine Artist, aesthetics with the function of emotional connection is something I have a deep and thorough understanding of. I have had experience at one of the UK’s largest Digital Marketing agencies, AmazeRealise, and a 1 month paid placement at Modern Art Oxford’s Marketing department.",2020,Global Marketing Manager,Black Insomnia Coffee Company,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10844485,http://blackinsomnia.coffee,jamesglester98@gmail.com,7483456361, , ,Greater Oxford Area,Food & Beverages,|Sent brand refresh blog|sent case study|sent pitch|🦆-default-followup-1|🦆-default-invited,,

This has been in the capacities of Sales Director, Commercial Director and Managing Director. Since forming CMS Electracom’s UK operation in 2009, my efforts have been targeted towards the development and manufacture of electrical, cable management, data and AV solutions to the office furniture market. Having succeeded in these positions, I believe I can demonstrate broad general management experience and in depth sales and marketing knowledge. I particularly enjoy the development of innovative offers and have considerable experience in the realisation of technical sales and marketing initiatives through market interpretation. This has included the founding and the development of an SME company.   I am also well versed in ensuring the viability of business not only from the prospective of future strategic direction, but also in the aspects of matching market opportunities with resources and skill sets.    This is further supported by being fully conversant in a business to business environment.  Previous responsibilities have additionally included the identification and the development of business in International markets.  To date these have been within Central Europe, East Asia, North America and the Middle East. Inevitably, I am confident at operating at all levels and have a high degree of interpersonal ability. I remain ambitious by nature, with a considerable work rate and very much retain the desire to succeed.

My intuition often helps to unravel perplexing puzzles. Due to my interpersonal, organisational and influencing skills, I have over 20 years of success in executive management, strategy planning and implementation, market development, corporate finance and project finance in public corporations, including Gazprom from oil and gas industry and the Russian state mortgage agency from finance industry.  In Gazprom, I organised the debut IPO and eurobond placements, debt restructuring during the financial crises in 1998, Blue Stream project financing. Working in the mortgage agency, I developed the Russian mortgage market and securitisation from the scratch. Being a director of boards in a number of Russian and foreign companies I assisted with planning and implementing strategies. Last year I moved in the UK where I intend to start the next stage of my career. Currently the Sloan program in the London Business School is helping me to set new business and personal connections worldwide.
