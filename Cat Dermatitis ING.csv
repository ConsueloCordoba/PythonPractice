Research has found strong evidence that recurring skin issues—such as red or itchy skin, hair loss, chin acne, and recurrent ear infections—have a connection to the gut microbiome (bacteria and microbes living in the digestive tract). That’s because skin conditions are often caused by a defective immune system response, and about 70%–80% of the body’s immune cells live in the gastrointestinal tract.
 
In addition to interfering with proper immune function, an imbalanced gut microbiome can cause the intestinal walls to become more permeable, or “leaky” (a factor that’s associated with food allergies). Both of these effects—a compromised immune system and a leaky gut—can show up as skin problems. A dysfunctional gut environment is also prone to inflammation, which can trigger hyperactive immune responses all over the body.
 
Itching and other skin problems may be a clue that your pet’s gut microbiome is missing some key beneficial bacteria groups. 

A simple, at-home Gut Health Test can detect if your pet’s gut bacteria is out of balance and tell you how to improve it in order to relieve symptoms.💩🔬
