I have refined my data analysis skills, regularly developing and reviewing information reports to identify areas of improvement towards patient care. I have often been asked to provide IT support across this PCN, enchanting my computer literacy abilities further. I also correlate all complaints received for the Partnership and investigate these incidents, allowing me to utilise my patient service experience and communication abilities to achieve a suitable outcome for all parties. Within my previous role as Assistant Service Manager, I gained experience in managing highly diverse clinical and administrative teams within a pressured environment, whilst also being exposed to various groups of patients and HR related issues. My time-management and organisational skills were crucial due to the need of cross-site management across the locality. This involved assisting in preparing services for CQC visits and maintaining team morale during a service contract consultation period. This environment gave me the responsibility of using my initiative and resourcefulness to collect data though a variety of methods in order to complete financial forecasting within set deadlines, showcasing my ability to work under pressure and my competence in using multiple computing systems and Microsoft office programs. I have also previously operated within a management and HR role for 5 years, giving me knowledge of employment legislations and designing and implementing KPI's. Maintaining appropriate levels of health and safety in the workplace and line managing a team of varying performance levels with regular performance reviews were also conducted. Due to my hunger to work within the health sector and further personal development, I obtained my ILM Undergraduate degree in Management, fuelling my passion further for developing those around me. I also undertook a voluntary position within a GP surgery to gain a further understanding of NHS structures and different working environments. The governance roles and responsibilities that I was exposed to in this position helped mould my professional outlook and perception of the sector from an early point in my career, helping me evolve and develop through each of my roles since.","2019","Practice Manager","NHS","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1977","http://www.nhs.uk/"," "," "," "," ","Catshill, England, United Kingdom","Hospital & Health Care","🦆-default-invited","",

I had already learned how to maximise business potential and stand out from the crowd while adhering to stringent laws. I have developed excellent leadership skills but at the same time have remained firmly rooted in the belief that a leader is only as good as her team.  I take great interest in the personal development of my staff, the trainee you employ today is a potential Practice manager of tomorrow.  At this time two receptionists commence HCA training in September, one HCA starts her training as Practice Nurse having previously qualified in her native Switzerland and another, I know, will do well within the CCG.   My own personal development takes place a lot at home.  I have passed a course securing an Introductory Certificate in Healthcare Finance with the HFMA  adding a total of 15 hours to my CPD.  I've also introduced practices to Facebook worked on websites and pushed personal boundaries on a PowerPoint presentation set to a soundtrack for CQC. New developments within the NHS often have me developing a handout, always titled 'in brief' which cuts through gargon and simplifies changes for my staff.  I have previously done this for the Friends and Family test and more recently WISC. As well as growing at practice level I have also made myself known over a much wider field.  I have always had support from Feltham Health Centre, Hounslow and Richmond Community healthcare are a great team I can't praise them highly enough.  Over the years I have also built a solid relationship with Hounslow CCG, London Borough of Hounslow Public Health, NHS Property Services, SystmOne and NHS England, this hasn't always been easy but it has been challenging and rewarding.

Additionally, the role contributes to the care setting as a positive learning environment which promotes a value based, person centred approach to care and learning. The CHEF  facilitates and enhances cross sector working thus complementing the established practice education infrastructure within the territorial health boards across NHS Scotland. As CHEF I am a resource for mentors and registred nurses in the Care Homes that I link in with and support. I can signpost them to education, information to faciliate them to improve the learning environment and thus positively impact on the care being delivered.  With the introduction by the NMC of Revalidation I have seen myself supporting mentors and Care Home registered nurses in understanding the process and impications of Revalidation and how it closely links with mentoring.

I am very much a people's person and enjoy spending time motivating like-minded colleagues.  I have held several roles including dual dental practice in Southampton area as a Business Manager. We managed over 14k patients between the two practices. My responsibilities were to grow the profitably of both practices whilst supporting & guiding my managers in maintaining the business. 2015 - Sept 2016 - DPAS Ltd I worked for  DPAS Ltd supporting 140 dental practices in the South & South East. I want to bring both my management & dental knowledge that I pocess to these practices which in turn helped them to build their business's. I developed a relationship with each practice, helping them to increase plan patient numbers and increasing practice revenue.  Until September 2013 I was a Practice Manager with 16 years experience in the dental health sector,  I pride myself on being considerate, honest, consistent, loyal and dedicated.  I enjoy working with the general public and working closely with my staff, striving to accomplish good working relationships and equal opportunity. I was involved in local training and support groups for dental nurses. Along with a small team I was involved in creating the Dental Nursing magazine which is still standing strong. It was during the stage when dental nurses were not registered with GDC & I felt very strongly that there needed to be something which would allow the dental nurses to have their say.","2021","Sarum PCN - Operations Manager","NHS England","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2786868","http://www.england.nhs.uk"," "," "," ","Rebecca_Morr1s","Shaftesbury, England, United Kingdom","Hospital & Health Care","|🦆-default-invited","",
